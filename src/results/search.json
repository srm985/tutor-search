This helps to motivate a student to learn and connect with another culture, something that is very important in today's world.  \n\nMy BA is in Spanish and French, my MA is in Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language from New York University and my doctoral studies are in the area of International Education.  While living in Chile, I tutored secondary and elementary level students and taught undergraduate courses at a private university.  \n\nMy teaching style is communicative.  Though I place emphasis on the ability to communicate ideas, I also stress grammar and vocabulary.  All the skills (reading, writing, speaking, listening) are fundamental to becoming proficient in a second language.  My classes focus on mastering all skills and the methods are meaningful and relevant to the age of the student I tutor.",

I have mentored high school students AP/SAT and IB, as well as diplomats, development specialists in one-on-one training. Many of my former students are now successful professionals in Latin American countries, working with local counterparts.

Spanish lessons from my home via Skype is another possibility in case you are interested. \n\nTeaching Spanish in other countries has been also part of my assets, because as a native Spanish speaker, I acknowledge the challenges of learning a foreign language.  since  I am also fluent in English, German and Italian.

I have expertise in a number of areas, but I specialize in many aspects of English and Spanish language instruction: reading and note-taking skills, listening skills, vocabulary, grammar, speech, writing and proof-reading, pronunciation and accent reduction, translation, and interpretation. \n\nI hold two graduate degrees in education: a Master of Education in Curriculum and Instruction with a specialization in Bilingual/ESL Education, and an Educational Specialist in Educational Leadership.

Moreover, although I am a native speaker of English, I understand the process of language acquisition firsthand from my own experiences studying abroad and learning Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Italian. \n\nMy passions are learning and teaching, and as both a student and as a teacher I have witnessed the rapid, efficient growth in skills that can come from from tutoring.

Some of my students who are pharmacists are required to have high scores on the TOEFL exam, including 26 on speaking.

Students can expect a warm and supportive learning environment. I pride myself on being able to identify an individual's strengths, and using them as encouraging starting points to target areas to work on. I will use your materials, review specific concerns, and augment each session with conversation practice. Additionally, I can recommend websites and materials that you may find helpful. Depending on the age of student, we can also review study skills.\n\nAbout me: I love traveling and learning about foreign cultures. I've traveled extensively to French and Spanish speaking countries, most recently to Costa Rica and Ecuador. I also have a background in nature photography.

            "FreeResponse": "My name is Brandon. I'm 33 years old (15 years teaching and tutoring experience) and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Spanish on April 22nd, 2011 from Weber State University in Ogden, Utah. I graduated with Departmental Honors in Spanish and was selected by three of my professors in the Education Department to be one of thirty five alumni at the university to be on the Professor's Honor Roll. I taught Spanish 1, 2, and 3 as a Spanish Instructor at a private college (OWATC) for two years. All of the students grew in conversational Spanish skills, had fun, and I absolutely loved my experience with them.  I held two main Spanish Tutor positions at Weber State University for 1 1/2 years and helped other students progress in their courses. I took Spanish in junior high and high school. I became fluent in speaking, reading, writing, and translating while serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Mexico for approximately two years by listening to the Mexican people, sharing religious beliefs and eternal truths, translating, studying, and applying new knowledge immediately and frequently. I lived, served, and learned in La Cruz de Elota, El Dorado, Costa Rica (city), El Dorado, Tanques, Escuinapa, Mazatlán, La Paz, Culiacán, and Rosario, Sinaloa for a total of  1 1/4 years. I also live in San José del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas for another 7 1/2 months. The life lessons that I learned with the Mexican people are priceless and some of the most valuable lessons I have ever learned. I am and will be grateful and blessed forever from experiencing and learning the Mexican culture. I am also an Eagle Scout (1990).\n\n            After returning home I built upon my previous experience by continuing collegiate-level courses, my favorite being a study abroad course to Guatemala to help women, who were the descendants of Mayan ancestors, to develop mini-businesses and improve their economic circumstances to provide schooling for their daughters in rural (San Pedro de la Laguna) Guatemala. Our group also learned common phrases spoken in the native dialect there called Tz'utujil and visited the Mayan Ruins of Petén in northern Guatemala. I returned to Ogden to give a presentation of my experience in Petén to interested members in the community.\n\n            I continued to improve fluency by attending a Spanish-speaking branch for church, making Spanish-speaking friends by using Spanish in public, including natives from Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, and Spain, listening to Juan Luis Guerra and many other Latin singers, and much more. I volunteered to teach ESL classes at the Weber County Main Library in Ogden to men and women wanting to learn English that couldn't afford paying for it. Most were Spanish speakers, but there were  two students from Taiwan and one from Russia who attended. The highlight was taking them to a nearby grocery store and having them ask random employees where things were located. Their confidence level went up amazingly that day. I also volunteered as a reading tutor at an elementary school to help children improve their reading comprehension skills, as well as volunteering at the World Language Fair two times to help direct and assess Spanish-student skills at the junior high level in poetry and friendly competition between school teams in the Spanish Culture Bowl. I helped with parent teacher conference, translating for Spanish-speaking parents who wanted to help their children in a more effective way. I love the Spanish language and have enjoyed sharing it with many friends of a variety of ages. I have been tutoring in person and online with Wyzant Tutoring for several years now and enjoy how I am not only allowed, but encouraged to cater to the individual needs of each client.\n           I love tutoring with Wyzant because I can focus on and cater to the needs and life of my students at their pace and teach exactly what they want to learn. I also like to help my students use the language in real-life situations when they are ready, to boost their confidence, knowledge, and experience using the Spanish language. It is a privilege to help my clients achieve their educational goals, whatever they may be. I am eager to meet you interested clients!  Please contact me soon to get started!",

I majored in German as an undergraduate, and I lived in Germany for more than three years, both in the North (in the city of Kiel) and in the South (in Munich/Muenchen). I returned from Germany to the United States to earn my master's degree in teaching English as a second/foreign language.  Over all, I have taught ESL (English as a Second Language) and German more than 10 years, in Germany, Central America, and the United States.  I have taught and tutored students/clients ranging in ages from 16-80+, in a variety of settings: one-on-one, in small groups, at private universities, public universities, and refugee centers.  In addition, I am also fluent in Spanish, after living more than two years with local families in Panama and Nicaragua. \n\nI enjoy breaking down a language into easily understood chunks or blocks of information, so that my students/clients can solidly build on this information.\n\nProbably the best story I can share regarding my language teaching/tutoring is the following:\n\nWhile in Nicaragua, I adopted a nine-year-old boy, who moved back to the US with me.  He didn't know a word of English before entering the third grade in the American school system.  He was in a bilingual program for only one semester, when I enrolled him into an English-only classroom later that fall.  His principal was against my transitioning him so soon, but I was confident about the work he and I were doing together at home.  His fourth grade teacher said she had never seen a student transition so smoothly before, after only six months in a bilingual program.  The hard work my son, Carlos, and I put into his mastering the English language \"paid off,\" and it can for you too! \n\nFinally, I am a public speaker and trainer and have a great deal of computer-related experience, including PowerPoint and Quickbooks.  I have references for very satisfied bookkeeping clients that I would be happy to share with you. \n\nI look forward to working with you and/or your son or daughter, whether it's in German, English, English as a second language, public speaking, computers, and/or QuickBooksPro.",

            "FreeResponse": "~*One of the Top 250 Tutors of 2014 nationwide*~ \n(out of 72,000+ tutors)\n\nHello and welcome to my page! My name is Edite (pronounced - Eedeet).  I have a degree in Accounting (Cum Laude) and I used that knowledge while I worked at Marriott Headquarters for 14 years. My real passion is languages: I speak 4 idioms, one creole and one dialect. I am a native Portuguese speaker and U.S. citizen. I worked for the United Nations for 11 years where I came in contact with many different languages and cultures. I am also a United Nations French proficiency certified linguist. I've been teaching languages and different subjects for many years now. As a Phi Kappa Phi scholar, I have been a mentor at University of Maryland U.C. for four years and will always be committed to serving my community and beyond. \n\nI am a patient and very enthusiastic tutor that opts for classes that are fun and easy to follow with an extremely pleasant and positive attitude. I am a people's person, so I love to share the excitement that I have for my tutoring subjects and am able to derive value from seeing my students succeed. Everyone is different with their individual learning style. Therefore, my classes are custom-made as I adjust them to each student's challenges, preferred learning style and pace. Believe me, nothing replaces the one-on-one learning interaction. \n\nMY GENERAL AVAILABILITY:\nMonday through Friday: 12:00 PM - 8:00 PM\nSaturday: 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM at my residence\nSunday: Negotiable if given enough notice, and tutoring at my residence\n\nBEFORE WE GET STARTED\n- You can email me at any time, as many times through Wyzant and inquire about my services.\n- Before requesting to meet and/or get my contact number, please have payment credentials on file. Wyzant requires this, WITHOUT exceptions.\n- For this effect, you need to contact Wyzant to open an account.\n\nI AM HERE TO SERVE YOU:\n- All my certified tutoring subjects are listed below and appear in bold text. For now, I am not tutoring the non-bold subjects.\n- If you provide me with an opportunity to tutor you, I will do my very best to help you succeed in your studying subjects.\n- Do not hesitate in asking questions and voicing concerns.\n- Please feel free to provide suggestions on how I can serve you better.\n\nSOME HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS\n- Please be on time for your scheduled sessions. Tutoring charges begin at your scheduled starting time (NOT at your late arrival time). \n- Tutoring ends promptly at your scheduled ending time unless you intend to extend the session at your own expense, and in case I’m not booked the following hour.\n- Please do not request that a slot be held for you, unless you definitely plan on using it. You would not want me to waste your time, so please, return the favor.\n- If you are having trouble in your studies, please do not expect your grade to improve immediately to an \"A\" right after the first few tutoring sessions. It takes time and firm commitment on your part to start seeing results. \n- Practice makes perfect. Tutoring time alone will not do it. Please practice also on your own, so that you can see progress. For languages, surround yourself with as much material like movies, TV, radio, natives, etc, as you can.  \n- Expect LOTS of repetition in language learning, especially for correct pronunciation.\n- Please be honest, respectful, and fair in your ratings and reviews. I am NOT at fault if students do not practice their work nor follow the guidelines or advice I provide.\n\nCANCELLATIONS\n- Please note that if you repeatedly cancel your appointments, you risk losing your reserved slot. I reserve the right to take back the slots from those clients who cancel repeatedly.\n- When canceling, and for you NOT to be charged, please notify me - 24 hours prior to your scheduled session - via EMAIL through Wyzant's system and PHONE (my info is on Wyzant). \n- Please expect to be billed $35 for ALL cancellations occurring within 24 hours of the session’s scheduled starting time.\n\nBILLING\n- 1 hour is the minimal session length billed. If the session goes beyond the first hour, 2 full hours will be billed - no matter if it was for a 1/4 hour, 1/2 hour, etc.\n- If I’m expecting you at your scheduled session and you DON’T SHOW UP, after a 15-minute wait, you will be billed in full at your established rate and session length (be it 1 hour or 2).\n- Please DO NOT get angry because you were billed for NOT showing up or for Cancelling within the penalty window of 24 hours.\n- All payments are processed through Wyzant - NO exceptions.\n\nCustomer Satisfaction - Guaranteed!",

I’m highly flexible and contactable; I can work on short notice and can often proof-read documents almost immediately.  I only keep a very small and select group of students at any one time.  This enables me to get to know you better and makes our work together much more productive, effective, and enjoyable.  I am passionate about teaching and I work hard at it because there are few greater pleasures than helping someone master an idea and make it their own.\n\nAs a pediatric surgeon I have had the opportunity to convey important and complex scientific concepts to adults and children of all ages, usually under difficult circumstances.  I’ve learned to distill an idea and share it in its purest form, using plain language, visual aids whenever possible, and tailoring my approach to ensure that my student has grasped the concept.\n\nEinstein once wrote, \"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all art and science.\"  I believe the mysterious is beautiful because it dares us to understand it... and ALL humans are experts at understanding.

I have extensive experience with kids of all ages from tutoring, teaching English (while working in Costa Rica), coaching sports, being a camp counselor, and aiding with the college search/admissions. \n\nMy strengths are in the Humanities - English (language arts and literature), social studies, geography, history, Spanish, and related fields. I also have extensive experience with playing and coaching volleyball, soccer, softball/baseball, and basketball.  My experience includes working with students at each school level (elementary, middle school, high school, college) as well as adults learning English and Spanish.\n\nMy tutoring approach will be personalized to each student with whom I work. Along with the student, we will figure out strengths, weaknesses, and which learning style(s) are best for the student. We will then create a plan highlighting goals and strategies to employ in order to achieve a greater understanding of the subject(s). I often use humor and games to keep it fun and fresh, regardless of the subject. My overall teaching approach is to teach students to think for themselves and connect the material to their own life by using real examples and life experiences. \n\nFurthermore, I have been on the receiving end of tutoring. When I am tutoring a student, he or she will never feel embarrassed that they do not know something. I will challenge the student because I will see a great amount of potential, but I will not let the student feel overwhelmed or uncomfortable. \n\nI am happy to tutor in the student's home, a location of the student's choosing, or meet in a local library.",

I also have ample experience working with kids, from babysitting to tutoring to mentoring and beyond. I am particularly experienced working with elementary school students grades K-5 through AmeriCorps, which I participated in for two years in New York, where I'm from, before moving to California.\n\nI love tutoring because I firmly believe that excelling at school is one of the most surefire ways to improve your status in life. Coming from a low-income and often violent household, it was my dedication to schoolwork at an early age which enabled me to leave home to attend university and ultimately, to pursue my dream job(s) of writing while trying to make the world a better place. I especially love helping people of all ages learn how to read, as this is not only an important professional skill to have but can also have a tremendous healing effect and help you escape your present circumstances for a while. Being able to read is truly a gift!!!\n\nI have had one book published so far, am currently working on my second, and have articles regularly published by social justice organizations in the Bay Area and on the East Coast (New York and Boston).\n\nI've tutored students regularly ever since I was in middle school, both students younger than myself and those who were my age or even older, but were behind in a specific subject. I am also a graduate of the AmeriCorps City Year Program, having served at PS 57 in East Harlem, NYC, where I was the Service Leader (the head of a team of 10 tutors). I am also familiar with the Great Leaps Literacy Tutoring Program, and can apply the skills I learned through that program to tutoring kids even without official Great Leaps material. I currently volunteer at a transitional housing unit for women and children, where I provide Homework Help on a biweekly basis.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you, and hope that I can help your child achieve their academic goals!\n\nEDITING/E-TUTORING: Need an extra set of eyes on that term paper? Are you a techie struggling to describe your tech business to non-techies? Practicing for the SAT, GRE or ELA? I'm your human! For a reduced rate, rather than meeting in person, I am happy to edit your work electronically and provide valuable feedback. You will be able to ask me questions in real time using Gchat or text messaging. I will edit for content, clarity, and grammar; in the editing world, we call this both \"line-editing\" (punctuation, spelling, etc.) and \"content editing\" (development, organization, and so forth). All you need is some version of Microsoft Word and either Gmail or a cell phone. Improve your writing skills from the comfort of your own home!",

I have worked with both physics and math students for several years, concentrating at the middle and high school level with some college tutoring thrown in for good measure. I have also tutored elementary school children in all subjects. Watching the difference in my students when they grasp a new idea or method as their confidence grows is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. I love hearing of their future accomplishments! My tutoring is down to earth, without putting anyone on the spot and always includes a few laughs. Physics and math have always been fun for me, and I hope to show this to others. \nTutoring available in public locations. \nAlso, I speak conversational Spanish daily!",

I earned my bachelor's degree in education at the University at Pontificia Bolivariana in Medellin and then taught and tutored at Universidad Catolica de Oriente. In addition to my experience teaching at the Seattle K-8 Catholic school, I have also worked with a number of other schools in the area, including one-on-one tutoring for kids, teenagers and adults alike. I have also been tutoring for several years at Seattle Central College, in the transitional education ESL program, helping adult ESL students transition to life in Seattle.\n\nFor Spanish students, I love helping you to learn a beautiful and important world language and hope that you will be able to travel and use your hard earned skills. For ESL students, I too was once an ESL student in high school and university and know both the challenges and sense of accomplishment that comes from improving your skills.\n\nTeaching and helping others is my passion; I love doing it.

            "FreeResponse": "I went to Princeton University and majored in molecular biology.\n\nI've been tutoring continuously since high school, both as a private tutor and as a volunteer, in subjects all across the board. I simply really love education -- both learning and teaching.\n\nAnd I always excelled at standardized testing, so I enjoy helping students succeed by taking the stress and mystery out of the verbal, math, and grammar/syntax questions on the SAT, ACT, and other common tests.\n\nIf you've been muddling along with algebra or the ACT has you hitting your head against the wall, I've got your back! Focused but encouraging, enthusiastic but personable, I've patiently helped my students reach that \"light-bulb moment\" countless times. \n\nGuiding someone to understanding a concept they struggle with is of course a major part of tutoring, but I'm also really big on coaching students to be methodical and have a system. Content knowledge is only part of the puzzle; problem-solving skills are crucial. Check out my testimonials to hear from my students themselves on that! \n\nSince moving to Chicago in September 2017, I've worked with students in CPS, private school (e.g., Parker), and college -- from 3rd graders to college seniors, and in between! -- as well as adults going back to grad school. Scroll further to the My Background section if you'd like to read more about my experience.\n\n*** HOW TO WORK WITH ME ***\n\nWhen you message me, please include where you would like to meet -- read the FAQ section below for location options. You can also move things along by suggesting a time or two.\n\nMeetings in-person have a 1-hour minimum. If you'd like to have a free, 10-minute introductory talk for any questions or concerns, we can certainly do that over the phone or Skype -- please provide your contact info in your message.\n\nFor the 2017-2018 school year, I'm already booked over Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings+afternoons. I am available over the holidays.\n\n*** FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ***\n\nA tutoring session is typically 1 to 2 hours long, during which we work on material like homework problems or practice questions in test prep books. (If you have such materials, please bring them to our first session!) One or two sessions per week is most common, but it's completely up to you.\n\nSessions typically happen at one of these public libraries: \n- Logan Square (3030 W Fullerton; open 10a-6p MW, 12-8p TTh, 9a-5p FSa)\n- Lincoln-Belmont (1659 W Melrose; open 10-6 MW, 12-8 TTh, 9-5 FSa)\n- Portage-Cragin (5108 W Belmont; open 12-8 MW, 10-6 TTh, 9-5 FSa)\n- Mayfair (4400 W Lawrence; open 12-8 MW, 10-6 TTh, 9-5 FSa)\n- Jefferson Park (5363 W Lawrence; open 10-6 MW, 12-8 TTh, 9-5 FSa)\n- Bucktown-Wicker Park (1701 N Milwaukee; open 12-8 MW, 10-6 TTh, 9-5 FSa)\n- Sulzer (4455 N Lincoln; only available 1-5p Sat)\n\nMeeting at your home or nearby is also a possibility -- just ask! (Note that I do not have a car, so please provide an address or the nearest intersection so I can evaluate how I'd get there.)\n\nOnline tutoring is also an option I've successfully used with several students. For those who are in the suburbs or have busy schedules, meeting over Skype is a viable way for me to help you! Contact me and we can chat more about it.\n\n*** MY BACKGROUND ***\n\nVolunteer tutoring in high school and college, private tutoring since 2008. Primarily with students in middle school, high school, or college / graduate school, but also late elementary school.\n\nHigh school salutatorian (2nd in a class of 500+), with an International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma.\n\nExtensive SAT tutoring experience: one high school junior raised her math score by 180 points, and another student raised her total score by 140 points.\n\nHere's a highlight of my scores: 800 on the SAT Verbal section and the SAT Subject Test for Math Level 2; 740 or higher on my other SAT sections and Subject Tests; on the GRE, 164 Verbal, 169 Math; and 5 on AP Biology, Chemistry, Calculus AB, U.S. History, English Literature & Composition, and Spanish Language.\n\nI was an English co-instructor for three months in a private university in rural China and obtained certification in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL).",

            "FreeResponse": "I've been tutoring for years, starting in high school as a Spanish and ESL tutor toward community service hours. In college, I went on to work as an SAT tutor for a private company, and then I decided to go out on my own. I've worked with many students, both in the U.S. and abroad, who have struggled with grasping a foreign language. From English instruction at university in southern Mexico to private Spanish lessons for adult learners in N.Y, I've truly worked with every kind of student. In addition, I've subbed in various primary schools in the Huntington school district. \n\nI love tutoring because it allows me to get to know my students closely and to cater to their individual needs, which is more difficult in a classroom setting. My main goal is for my students to develop critical thinking skills that are essential to language learning but can also be transferred to other areas of life, such as college, the workplace, and the personal realm. \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\"\n\nAside from my degrees in Spanish and translation, I have authentic, long-term experience with the language. I started studying Spanish at age 10, always with teachers who were native speakers. I spent a summer studying linguistics in Madrid and eventually moved to the rural state of Chiapas, Mexico, after my undergrad studies. There I lived on a small diary ranch for two years, learning and using Spanish everyday to complete my tasks as an agricultural worker. I still use my Spanish frequently as a self-employed document translator. \n\nI've always prided myself for getting an 800 on the SAT Writing! Other than test scores, though, what speaks to my English skills is my long history of online articles. My informative pieces on writing, college admissions, and the SAT have been published on websites like FastWeb, College Confidential, U.S. News, Accepted, and more. In addition, my graduate degree required coursework in Editing. \n\nWhether it's your Spanish or your English writing you wish to perfect, please contact me for more details. I would love to start working with you!",

            "FreeResponse": "I have a Master’s degree in economics from the University of Arizona and have tutored in the Washoe County School District (WCSD) for over 10 years logging over 1,000 hours with students from 7 to 18 years old.  I work with students in a class setting and after school on an individual basis and in groups of three or more.  The tutoring sessions offer assistance in homework coupled with reinforcing concepts that were introduced in class.  \n\nMy tutoring approach is tailored to each student’s learning style with the goal of building confidence and the love of learning into the student’s academic life.  For those students who prefer a visual learning style, I break down the assignment or concept into visual steps using diagrams and images.  For the student who prefers an aural learning style, I offer concepts using music and sound. For those who enjoy a more physical learning environment I use a kinesthetic approach with games that offer a sense of touch. With each step, my goal is to give them the tools and desire to produce results on their own! \n\nAs a parent of two WCSD graduates, I acknowledge different learning styles and realize that are many ways to approach an assignment or a new concept and as a tutor, I need to find the method that works for your student.\n\nOver the last 10 years, I have seen any number of the students I have tutored grow from a (sometimes) struggling student, to a proud high school graduate walking across the stage to receive their honors diploma!\n\nI am qualified to tutor math through Algebra 1, English, French and Spanish.  Through attending school in Switzerland, I am fluent in French. I have worked with any number of ELL students, mostly Spanish-speaking, but other languages as well.  I have found often role-playing and games help student enjoy learning another language. I relate the learning to everyday situations to provide cues that allow for easier recall. \n\nIn English, I focus on essay writing, the rules of grammar and learning to enjoy reading.  Students with whom I have worked successfully include those who have just arrived in the United States speaking very little English, those with learning disabilities and those who were taking AP English.  Reading aloud, working with vocabulary and flashcards and breaking down essay writing have helped these students tremendously as many have gone onto college.\n\nIn Math I avoid focusing on rote memorization of rules, instead focusing on application of the rules to create a problem-solving mindset. I relate math to everyday situations and apply the math concepts to real world examples.  This technique has been successful to help students understand the value of a strong foundation in math.\n\nIn general, my approach with students is to build on their study habits (teaching them to fish, rather than just giving them a fish!) and to translate their learning style into test-taking techniques.

I have worked with students attending High School (Torrey Pines, Canyon Crest Academy, Francis Parker, The Bishop's School, Cathedral Catholic High School, La Jolla High School, Pacific Ridge School, The Waldorf School of San Diego, and more), Middle School (Carmel Valley Middle School, San Diego French and American School), College (UCSD, Minnesota University). Also, I am a Professor at the University, and I offer taylor-made programs focus on the needs of my adult students. \nI love helping students with their Spanish classes, getting them ready for a trip to a Spanish speaking country,  or preparing them for a standardized tests like AP Spanish Language & Culture, SAT Special Subject Spanish, IB Spanish. In my classes I always find new ideas to teach grammar and vocabulary. I use different videos and podcasts to improve my students' listening and speaking skills, and to teach Spanish culture.\nI am used to the different American textbooks used in Middle, High School and College, but I also have plenty of materials, and books coming from Spain that I like to share with my students. These textbooks have a more communicative approach, and my students generally enjoy them.\nI have created my own blog where my students can find information related with the Spanish Language & Culture, recipes, Spanish exhibitions, grammatical and cultural notes, Spanish jokes... In addition, they can leave their opinions, communicate with other students or with myself... everything using the target language (Spanish).\nI have a large experience with Corporate Spanish classes. These are tailor-made classes that will help a corporation with its specific needs in Spanish. I have trained a wide amount of executives, professionals, and college students in Spanish as a Second Language, Business Spanish as well as cross-cultural coaching.\nThank you for having taken the time to read my profile. I would like to have you or your kids as student. \nI look forward to hearing from you soon!\n¡Hasta pronto!",

I’m a native Italian speaker and a passionate language teacher with extensive experience working with students of all ages, in many different cultural contexts. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Social Work, from the University of Florence, and I started my teaching career in Special Education more than 10 years ago. Since then, I’ve taught Spanish, Italian, and English in India; conducted Italian, Spanish, and English scuba diving courses in Thailand; have worked as an interpreter and translator at conferences, for corporate clients, and for legal firms; and have helped students at a range of fluency levels improve their skills as a private language instructor.\n\nMy passion for learning new languages started as a teenager in school, and my love of international travel helped me put these skills to use. I gained fluency in Spanish through extended stays in Mexico and Latin America, and because of this immersive exposure I can now move fluidly between Italian, Spanish and English. In addition to the great deal of language experience I have as a traveler, I have spent the last 8 years teaching Spanish and Italian as a foreign language to elementary school children, adult students at language institutes and universities, and to corporate clients in intensive language training workshops. In addition, I’ve served as an interpreter in a variety of settings and worked as a Spanish, Italian, and English translator for technical and legal documents. I have been a Wyzant tutor for the past two years, accruing almost 200 hours of instruction through in person and online classes.\n\nMy unique background, including my work outside of an academic setting, helps to keep my language skills fresh and my lessons fun, relevant, and useful. In addition, my experience working with learners of varying abilities means that I can quickly grasp your unique learning style and work with you to create a personalized academic plan with clear and achievable goals. \n\nI can’t wait to put my diverse experience, passion for teaching, and strong language skills to work for you! \n\nPlease get in touch.",

While teaching in general has been something I have done in my professional career as a bilingual teacher and minister, teaching and helping students master the Spanish language is something that brings me joy in particular. My priority is to always see that my students' needs are met through informal assessments, reinforcement, interactive practice and time for practice alone.  I strive for correction and proper usage, always giving and receiving feedback, and always seeking that my students enjoy what they are learning. \n\nI hope to be able to work with you and continue to learn and practice together the wonderful lengua española. \n\nPlease contact me with your questions or comments.

I have worked as a school administrator and principal/vice principal for almost 10 years, overseeing the successful Middle States re-accreditation of two Maryland schools, and have taught a wide variety of subjects from math and language arts to Biblical studies, foreign language and literature. My passion, even as a principal, has been always to be in the classroom: I love to see young people's faces as they actually get it! There's nothing as rewarding as teaching what you know and seeing the student show others!\n\nI have a bachelor's degree in foreign language--including modern and ancient languages--and a master's (and post-graduate work) in Biblical languages and studies.  \n            \nMy experience as a teacher includes classroom teaching, tutoring, seminars, small study groups, individualized student profiles, and teaching training. This teaching has covered the full range from elementary, middle, and high school; adult education; and paid and volunteer tutoring. My extensive involvement in private, public, and homeschooling education allows me to meet the diverse needs of today's student.\n\nAs an administrator/principal, I have overseen teacher-development; curriculum revision, creation, and development; accreditation; and parent involvement. My passion has been to give parents and schools a \"right-arm support\" to their students' education. I understand the community, and I raise academic standards to meet the challenges that the community brings with results that parents demand. \n\nMy step-by-step, easy-to-learn approach to explaining difficult math concepts. Because I have taught math and English in elementary, middle, high school students, and adults, I know how to make all math concepts easy to understand. I specialize in elementary math and language arts, algebra 1 and 2, geometry, writing essays and research papers, grammar, spelling, and reading comprehension.\n\nSAT, ACT, GED, Praxis, and other standardized test preparation put all these concepts together; I help students of all ages use \"tricks and techniques\" to use the questions to their advantage. Rather than leaving blanks, students that I work with boost their scores by using these methods to answer these questions!\n\nLet me know how I can help your child succeed in school and take tests with confidence.",

I believe that a student doesn't have to be the \"best student.\" but I believe that all students can reach their best when taught with techniques that fit their individual needs and with lots of encouragement.  Many of my students enter class feeling that they \"can't\" learn Spanish, but most leave with the confidence and skills to take their learning to the next level. Because I am not a native speaker of Spanish I understand how daunting learning a new language can be. Many of my students choose to study Spanish in college or use their language on mission trips. I think learning should be fun and I plan lessons based upon student interest. Studying English was my first love and I still enjoy sharing that love with students. I think of grammar like a puzzle and that most people can become better masters of English once they learn how the pieces fit together. Literature to me is art in words, heavily influenced by the history of the time in which it was written and by the life of the author who committed the story to paper. \nI look forward to helping you or your student reach his or her potential.

            "FreeResponse": "Dear Sir / Madam,\r\n\r\nI have 15 years of professional experience as an educator. I hold a bachelor's degree in Education with emphasis in Mathematics and Physics education. I have had the opportunity to serve as a teacher at different schools as well as different grade levels.\r\n\r\nThroughout my career I have had the opportunity to teach in different school settings in two countries: USA and Venezuela (South America), which has allowed me to gather experience in different approaches to teaching.\r\n\r\nI hold teaching licenses in the area of mathematics for two states in the United States: Indiana and Virginia.\r\n\r\nI have teaching experience in middle school as well as high school mathematics. Among the districts and/or schools I have worked for are: Spratley Middle School (Hampton, Virginia), Maury High School (Norfolk, Virginia), Christel House Academy (Indianapolis, Indiana).\r\n\r\nParticular subjects I have taught are: High School Geometry, Algebra II, High School Integrated Math I and II. Integrated Math is a combination of High School Algebra, High School Geometry and Statistics blended in one course. Some high schools use the integrated math approach as opposed to the traditional high school math pathway or sequence of Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, Trigonometry, etc.\r\n\r\nMy tutoring approach consists of gathering as much information as possible in regards to content to be covered and expectations for the class my student is taking. Once this information is gathered and analyzed, I proceed to plan according to the time frame available to meet the goals of the class.\r\n8\r\nWhen tutoring I use constant assessments to check for understanding. If tutoring one-on-one then usually clear and effective communication between me and my student allows me to check for progress and understanding.\r\n\r\nI also believe and use a gradual release approach (I do, We do, You do). \"I do\" refers to me demonstrating a particular concept or skill. \"We do\" is more interactive in which my student and I interact and share opinions on how to solve a math problem. Finally \"You do\" refers to my student working independently and building confidence by solving problems on his/her own. After all this process or cycle, my student and I analyze the independent work and we go over right and wrong answers or procedures. This process allow my student and I to determine whether we can and should move on, or go back and review content.",

Research indicating that intelligence is not fixed at birth.  For those of us who were told we would never amount to much academically, what could be better news?  We are not the sum of our test scores.  We are brighter, more capable, and more curious than we ever believed possible. \n\nAs the mother of an autistic child--and as someone who has tutored children who have difficulties in the mainstream classroom--I am sympathetic to children who need additional support.  Have you ever heard the saying \"my student is my teacher?\"  It is an approach I am passionate about because it is holistic.   When a teacher understands what it is that makes a student click, the words \"Do your homework?\" are no longer the prelude to a battle.\n\nAs for my qualifications, I am fluent in Spanish, experienced in teaching study skills, and my areas of expertise are literature and language.  I have taught both adults and children in the classroom and private classes.  I am also a published author. Rest assured, I want your child to succeed as much as you do.  \n\n\nPlease contact me to schedule a lesson.  I require twenty-four hours cancellation notice.",

            "FreeResponse": "Hello! My name is Yilliams and I graduated from San Diego State University earning a B.A. in Mathematics. As an undergrad student I began to get myself involved in education, and decided to become a math tutor. Through the program Pathways from the College of Education at San Diego State University, I became an in class tutor for a Freshmen Integrated Math I class. My role as in in class tutor was to keep students focused and engaged on the subject. As well as to provide one to one or small group tutoring. This experience helped me see that my true passion was to help others through education. Later, as I finished my undergrad I got accepted to the Dual Language Program credential program as SDSU. As a student teacher I got the opportunity to create math lesson plans from scratch that went along to the established curriculum. Through teaching and lesson planning I learned how to tailor my lesson to accommodate to my student’s needs. Also, I was able to establish great relationships with my students based from what I learned as a tutor. \r\n\r\nI have been tutoring for three years and teaching in a bilingual setting for a Freshmen Integrated Math I class for one year. As a tutor I had different age groups of student ranging from elementary to high school. Students ranging from learning how to read to, more mathematical complex concepts, and recently teaching Integrated Math I for one school year in a bilingual setting. Twice a  week I would have tutoring sessions for my Integrated Math I students to help them solidify any misconceptions, or to prepare them for an upcoming test. Through keeping my classes mathematically challenging, based on their content level, my students were able to conceptualize mathematical topics essential for the next grade level.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to remove the stigma that mathematics is a difficult subject to understand, and that only certain students are good at it. I want my students to be able to conceptualize mathematics, instead of seeing math as simply procedural. Mathematics in fact can be procedural, but once the concept is truly understood, anyone can definitely do math!\r\n\r\nRemember, it is ok to make mistakes as long as you learn from them! ",

            "FreeResponse": "My inspiration for learning Spanish came at the age of seven. At that age, I met my best friend from Mexico, María. Her mother was a gracious host and took me in as her own, yet treated me as a royal guest. I began to get frustrated by the fact that I couldn't communicate directly with this beautiful woman, who I thought of as my second mom. I had to use the translation from my best friend to communicate with her. That is when I decided I'd like to be empowered with the skill to speak Spanish and bridge the communication gap that could open up a whole new world of friends and opportunity.\n\nI went on to take Spanish in college and received my Bachelor's in Spanish and continued on to obtain my teaching credential. I've studied abroad in Spain and Costa Rica and enjoyed working at an adventure company in La Fortuna, Costa Rica. I've taught almost seven years of high school Spanish and am now at home for a few years with my preschool and toddler aged children. I'm passing on to them the skill and love for the Spanish language. It brings me great joy to pass on this love and skill set to others. \n\nI think that I have a great understanding of the needs of those who are learning Spanish as their second language, because I was once in their same shoes. It allows me an upper-hand with foreseeing potential frustrations or difficulties the student may have. I offer real world experience and techniques on mastering the language. Plus, I make it fun! I strongly emphasize the importance of staying in the target language. I encourage Spanish conversation, and am eager to help with grammar and pronunciation and offer helpful tips to set you up for success.\n\nContact me to start learning from an experienced, credentialed teacher! I look forward to hearing from you.",

Let me guess: you're getting ready to run the gauntlet of standardized tests, AP courses, and college applications that guard admission to the school of your dreams, and it feels like that dream where you walk into a class naked, without having studied, and with no number-2 pencil. \n\nWe can beat that monster together. I'm a graduate of Wellesley College (undergrad) and Harvard University (masters), with an SAT of 760V/750M and a GRE score of 800V/770M (160/153 on the current scale). I have scored a 5 on both AP English tests, as well as the US History, Government, and Calculus exams (and a 4 on Art History). This isn't because I'm a genius--it's because I'm a good test taker, and I can help you become a better one as well. Whether you want to try to make dramatic gains on a test or you just need a bit of tweaking, I can tailor my approach to your needs.\n\nI was a peer tutor in college, I've taught English and political science at the high school and college levels respectively, and I've helped South African university students prepare for the GRE--so no matter where you fall on the spectrum, we can customize an approach to help you make the strides you want to make.\n\nI really love tutoring English, literature, and social studies, among others, so whether you're getting a summer school credit out of the way, struggling to get through a tough course, or shooting for an A and a 5 on the AP test, I'd love to help you. I also work with students on college admissions essays and can help you navigate the process in a way that takes the stress and panic out of it.\n\nCollege is so much more than a test score--but the test score is a prerequisite for getting there. Let's own it so you can have the college experience you dream of!",

I also went on to receive my Master’s in Spanish language and grammar after working in private business for several years. My favorite classes were taught by teachers who were passionate about their subjects, demanding of their students, and rigorous in their evaluation of my performance. I found that I learned the most from the teachers and professors who valued preparation, in-class performance, and test results—these types of teachers not only helped me excel academically, they also cultivated a strong work ethic that benefitted me in business and throughout my life.\n\nMy tutoring approach is modeled on the methods of my best teachers, professors, and mentors. Preparation, practice, and effort are key to achieving results. I will always make it my priority to ensure that my students are given the necessary tools to excel in their subject matter. Whether it is building a basic foundation of Spanish vocabulary and grammar, or preparing students for Spanish Advanced Placement testing, I will ensure that the shared goals of the student and parents are clearly identified, factored into our lesson plans, and considered in all evaluations.\n\nI currently teach audio/visual translation as an adjunct professor at Montclair State University, I have taught ESL, and have lived in several Spanish-speaking countries. I also have children who have studied Spanish over several years in our local school district, and am familiar with how extra tutoring in Spanish reading, writing, and oral proficiency can be of tremendous value as students advance, and when the time comes for AP testing.\n\nFor older students considering a career in language, I can offer my insight and experience having worked for several international communications companies, in addition to owning my own language services agency. Translation, editing, proofreading, and Microsoft Office and Adobe desktop publishing application skills are additional areas I can help students master. \n\nSince every student is different with his/her unique learning style, I welcome any input and feedback from students and parents. I am always available to discuss students’ and parents’ questions, remain easily accessible, and will work diligently to help students and parents achieve their goals.\n\nWhether you are a student interested in improving your Spanish language skills, or a parent hoping to help your child improve reading, writing, and oral proficiency, your success is my mission. Please do not hesitate to get in touch. And, if you are considering a career in translation or language services, I can help you develop the skills employers look for when considering new hires or contracting freelance work.",

            "FreeResponse": "Before coming to New York to pursue my Master's, I was a middle/high school Spanish teacher for three years. Besides the grammar, vocabulary, and writing lessons that were a part of my classroom, I also worked hard to instill in my students the mindset that learning isn't just reserved for the classroom. Keeping students engaged by showing them how  they can apply knowledge or a skill to their daily life is an important element of my lessons, and I have always enjoyed seeing students' confidence grow when they can see their progress.  \r\n\r\nIn college, I tutored several students in Algebra 1. Although many students struggle with math, this is one of my favorite subjects to tutor in because I have observed an increase in students' understanding of the material and their confidence in tackling difficult concepts successfully. \r\n\r\nI have a BA in Psychology and am very familiar with the concepts and terms that are discussed in an intro-level or even AP Psychology course. I also have experience tutoring students in Biology at both a regular and AP level.\r\n\r\nI am completely fluent in Spanish and am able to tutor students in reading, writing, and speaking the language. I have my teaching certification in Spanish for the state of Texas and I taught varying levels of Spanish to 8th-12th grade students for three years.  \r\n\r\nI have previously tutored students in the reading section of the ACT and helped them apply strategies for understanding the text and eliminating incorrect answer choices. \r\n\r\nI am available for tutoring Tuesday and Thursday after 6 pm and anytime on the weekends. I have some time available at other times during the week, so if you would like to suggest a day and time that is more convenient for your schedule just let me know! My rate is $35 an hour and I can travel to students. I look forward to hearing from you and helping you be more successful this school year!",

My style of tutoring combines time-honored learning techniques with modern technology and methodologies. Since each individual learns differently, my approach varies slightly with each student. I love to identify the difficulties a student is having and to develop an approach that builds that weakness into a strength! \n\nThe proof of my techniques lies in the long-term success of my students. Two of my Spanish students began our sessions totally lost, confused and discouraged. A few months later, they are both at the top of their Spanish classes, sometimes even explaining concepts to the other students! \n\nWhile Spanish grammar is my specialty, I also tutor reading (both phonics and comprehension), literature, college-level writing and statistics. I have worked with students from pre-school through adult and am comfortable with any age-range. \n\nI initially began tutoring as a way to earn an income during college and eventually earned a  Bachelor's  degree in counseling. After graduating, I realized that my true passion is for teaching, so I made the choice to make tutoring my primary career. I currently conduct sessions both on-line and in person. I generally prefer to meet in public places, but occasionally travel to student homes as well.",

As a non-traditional pre-medicine student pursuing a dual-degree in neuroscience and philosophy with collegiate and departmental honors at The University of Texas at Austin, these methods have allowed me to earn an overall GPA of 3.81 and several notable scholarships without radically sacrificing other areas of importance in my life. By adopting these methods—adapted to your particular academic needs and style of learning—I am highly certain that you will be sufficiently equipped to approach a diverse range of subjects and exams with the confidence and capability to improve your knowledge, grades, and scores in any.  \n\nBeing the eldest of four children, I began assisting my younger siblings in comprehending and completing their homework while I was in middle school.

Except in rare cases, his students readily submit their corrected assignments with few if any errors. Moreover, those of whom I have previously tutored through the WyzAnt platform, as evidenced by their ratings and reviews below, have experienced the benefits of utilizing methods that allow them to learn more efficiently.\n\nWith my extensive and diverse academic background along with the methods of academic efficiency that I will impart to you during our lessons, you will be provided with a challenging environment in which to develop your intellectual capabilities.

            "FreeResponse": "My inspiration for teaching stems from the excellent teachers I had throughout my years of study. These educators helped shape who I am personally and professionally. My professional contributions have been allocated to both the public and the private sector. In the public sector, I served as an Ambassador in Latin American countries and as an Alternate Representative of my country of origin, Nicaragua in the Organization of American States, (OAS) in Washington, DC. In the private sector, I worked as an International Consultant for companies in the USA and Latin America. The years spent in the diplomatic community truly enriched my knowledge of the Latin American Culture and the Spanish language. I am motivated to share all that I have learned, and continuously seek teaching experiences.  I have worked as Professor and Lecturer in Secondary Schools and Universities in various Latin American countries, and I have also taught private lessons to small groups of students and business executives. \n\nAs a native Latin American I understand that teaching my mother language means to not only focus on grammar, reading, writing and conversation; but to also include the Latin American culture, making the process of learning this new language more engaging and entertaining for the students.  My teaching system includes theoretical sessions and practical aspects of daily life.  Homework is also part of the learning process, without overwhelming the students with tedious assignments but through complementary fun activities, such as watching movies, songs, games and readings in Spanish, as well as periodic assessments and  progress reports. I am flexible in time while I do have a 24-hour cancelation policy.  I am happy to travel to different locations if it is convenient for the student.  Free consultation meetings are part of my professional services.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and helping you achieve success in learning a beautiful new Language.",

If you need some guidance with Spanish, ESL or Visual Arts let me help you! \n\nThis is a basic breakdown of how I approach the different students I work with:\n\n·Children ages 1 -10: \nI speak to them entirely in the target language. We learn the alphabet, numbers, how to read and converse. I have successfully taught one child to read in Spanish. When we started she was age 4, now 2 years later she is able to read and write at the same level she can in English. There is another child I started working with in September of 2015, she was already familiar with the alphabet and numbers but not able to converse. Now she can carry on basic conversations on a variety of topics; holidays, school, animals, friends (the topics that interest her most) in the different modes of time, present, past, future, conditional.  \n\n·Teens and college students:\nI look for patterns in errors; grammar, pronunciation, spelling. I explain why the mistakes occur, I then reintroduce content and provide new opportunities to practice through natural conversation. I've helped several students both in school and college raise their grades a letter grade or two. Keep in mind it takes time to improve grades. The sooner you seek help and the more time we have to go over concepts, the better the chances are you'll see the grade you desire. Also, please, send homework, quizzes, tests and classwork before each session. It gives me a chance to not only review errors but to create a better lesson based on your learning style.\n\n·Adult learners: \nWe work on specific topics each session with an emphasis on personal and everyday scenarios. I often use popular board games to practice and review in the target language. I have worked with an array of professionals including: military personnel, pilots, accountants, health care professionals, restaurant health inspectors, retail associates, hospitality and tourism employees, travel enthusiasts, company managers, teachers, psychologists, zoologists, political scientists, and also individuals desiring to learn Spanish for a significant other. I do my best to assess your level of knowledge, your learning styles and create lessons are stimulating and useful. \n\n\nHola me llamo Melissa. Soy mitad colombiana, mitad americana. Si necesita ayuda con inglés, mandeme un mensaje. Me encanta aprender idiomas y ensenarlos.\n\nAs for art, I've been drawing portraits since I was 13 and absolutely love it. If you are interested in learning basic drawing skills with pastel, graphite or charcoal, I can help you.",

I have tutored both English and Spanish students and helped them learn a second language.\n\nAs much as I love my major and my job as a teacher, I also love being active and having hobbies outside of work. \n\nTraveling opens the mind to new cultures and teaches you life lessons that are not so easily obtained inside a classroom. I travel as much as possible in order to meet new people, experience new cultures, and learn more about the human experience.\n\nI am very involved in sports and I coach volleyball for my school, play golf whenever I can, find new places to go on a hike, and cheer on the Denver Broncos every season.\n\nI believe music is medicine for the soul and have been playing the flute and piano since I was in 5th grade. I loved football and music so much that I joined the Golden Buffalo Marching Band while I attended CU Boulder.\n\nI have been excavating in Rome, Italy every summer since 2008. I started as a student and now I am working as an Assistant to the Registrar. I was responsible for the cleaning, cataloguing, and analyzing the artifacts our team pulled from the site. I used our database to enter artifact descriptions and analyses. I also supervised the undergraduate and graduate students and trained them the proper practices of artifact preservation.\n\nI have taught elementary (5th, 6th, and 8th grade) for the past 3 years. During that time, I taught a variety of subjects, including grammar and writing. Furthermore, grammar is incredibly important for a Classical historian and it is required that I use proper grammar at all times.\n\nI have my MA in Classical Art and Archaeology.

            "FreeResponse": "I have a lifelong love of the Spanish language which I desire to share with students.  Raised with early exposure to Spanish through my mother, who was also my high school Spanish teacher in a private, college preparatory school, I went on to major in Spanish in college and graduated with a 3.6/4.0 GPA. During my junior year abroad in Spain, I acquired near-native fluency which has stayed with me throughout my adult life.  Last summer when I traveled to Spain, I was often mistaken for a native. \n\nI have extensive teaching experience: private tutor, all ages and levels, both in person and on line;  homeschool class teacher (middle and high school aged); adult community school (enrichment classes); and community college courses.   I have a thorough understanding of Spanish grammar and am committed to helping students \"crack the code\" of a foreign language.  My friendly and positive approach encourages students to believe that they can succeed, and I equip them with the tools to improve their skills, confidence and grades through the use of my own materials which supplement the textbooks and curricula used in their schools.   It is also a joy to teach adult students who are motivated to learn Spanish, whether for professional or personal use. The lessons are tailored to the interests and learning style of the individual student.\n\nI also have bachelor's and master's degrees in music and have taught people of all ages and levels of musical ability.  Music history is always a component of my private teaching and choral rehearsals, and I have taught music history survey courses at a community college.  I have experience with a variety of learning styles, both as a Spanish teacher and as a teacher of music - voice, piano and guitar.",

            "FreeResponse": "Philosophy:\r\n\r\nWhen I was growing up I told my father that I wanted to be multilingual.  I studied French, Spanish, Italian, German, Russian and Arabic.  In addition to Portuguese and English, I now speak, read and write (native fluency), translate and interpret three of the six languages listed above.\r\n\r\nI also told my parents that I wanted to be a world traveler and learn about other cultures.  I did so and lived, worked and traveled in and to around 37 countries. My linguistic skills helped me break the ice and fit into those cultures, while my interest in history, geography and world religions (acquired through conversations with my grandfather) coupled by international relations and international business (derived from my studies and foreign service experience) further helped developing and maintaining interpersonal interests aroused.\r\n\r\nI basically taught all my life:  piano and dance, foreign languages, history and geography, linguistics, ESOL, wherever I lived and wherever I worked. I like the interaction with people.  And I like teaching them and opening their horizons.  My father and grandfather taught me the importance of reading and studying and be prepared at all times.  They also taught me the importance of listening, yet, being interactive by asking and answering questions.  \r\n\r\nThis is how I teach my students and this is what I bring in my bag:  preparation in my subject, patience, persistence, willingness to do whatever it takes to help someone achieve the best of his/her potential. I do not believe in memorization, but rather the understanding of what the matter is about, the development of that understanding  and the ability to recall the information when that is needed.  I believe that teaching is a two-way street: it requires a teacher to teach and a student to study.  The teacher teaches, the student reviews the information in class and after class.  Reviewing what was studied helps the brain retain the information. And the learning process is completed.\r\n\r\nI require my students to be serious and responsible before, during and after my classes.  Tutoring is an expensive extra-service being given and both the transmitter (teacher) and the receiver (students) should be accountable for it.  I like my students to express their doubts, ask questions, be inquisitive, show interest in what they are doing.  That is the reason I am there for. I also require my students to be patient, persistent and know that learning and retaining is an on-going process requiring constant refreshing during and after class.  I believe in taking one step at a time and repeat that step as many times as necessary until results are seen. I enjoy teaching and I enjoy seeing my students learn and making that time of teaching/learning the most enjoyable and fruitful for both participants.\r\n\r\nThis is my teaching-learning philosophy.  It has helped a countless number of students through a couple of generations.  (And it is still helping me on a daily basis, as one never stops learning).   I hope I be able to help and assist you as I assisted and helped others.\r\n",

            "FreeResponse": "A well-educated mind will always have more questions than answers. - Helen Keller\n\nThe art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery. - Mark Van Doren \n\nHello and thank you for considering me!  I am a University of Cambridge CELTA-certified English/ESL teacher, a magna cum laude graduate of Tufts University, and a dedicated educator. I have tutored and taught adults, youth and children in private lessons, the public school system and through nonprofit educational organizations for more than ten years. \n\nAs a teacher, I have three important priorities: 1) to help students to improve their English (or Spanish) communication and comprehension skills, 2) to build their self-confidence in speaking, reading and writing, and 3) most importantly, to enjoy learning.  I care deeply about my students' interests and goals, and that guides what and how we study together. I believe that learning should be interesting, challenging and fun, and I want my students to love learning as much as I love teaching. I travel throughout San Francisco and the Peninsula and also offer classes at a discounted rate in Pacifica.\n\nAs I get to know a student's learning style and personality, I see how each student learns best and I adapt my teaching style to find the best fit for each student. I'm a flexible and creative tutor, and I enjoy finding the most effective teaching methods for each of my students. I offer a free one-hour consultation meeting, so I can learn more about potential students and they can learn more about me before deciding to study with me. \n\nAs a professionally trained ESL teacher, I can teach students all aspects of the English language including speaking, conversation and public presentation, reading and listening comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, writing, English literature, and TOEFL test preparation. Please read my subject descriptions for more information on how I can help students in each area. \n\nI am an experienced English Language Arts teacher and am familiar with the California State/Common Core Language Arts Standards. I have taught all aspects of English Language Arts, with a special emphasis on reading comprehension and academic and creative writing. I also teach phonics, word decoding skills and fluency-building techniques for beginning and struggling readers. I have a specialty in the area of academic intervention: supporting students to learn and achieve their educational goals by helping them to discover their preferred learning styles and to effectively utilize learning strategies based on those learning styles. I believe that all students should have the joy of understanding what they read and the satisfaction of expressing their ideas clearly and compellingly in writing.\n\nI have helped scholars and students, from Stanford and UCSF PhD and post-doctoral scholars, to college, high school, and elementary school students, improve their ability to communicate their ideas, insights and creativity in both writing and public presentation. I have edited academic papers, grant proposals and articles for publication and helped students prepare presentations in the fields of Medicine, Biotechnology, Environmental Science, Psychology, English Literature, Spanish, and Business and Nonprofit Marketing. I especially enjoy helping non-native speakers of English communicate complex ideas in writing and speech.\n\nI teach SAT, ACT, CBEST, GED and TOEFL test preparation with a special emphasis on English, reading comprehension, writing and critical thinking skills. These tests measure not just skills and knowledge but test-taking ability, so I help students to develop effective test-taking strategies that build on their strengths and improve their weaknesses. \n\nI teach and tutor Spanish, and I am the editor of a Spanish textbook and workbook series published by Internacional del Español in Ecuador. As a Spanish as a Second Language speaker and the editor of a Spanish curriculum series, I can help students understand the crucial differences and intriguing similarities between Spanish and English. I can teach speaking and conversation, reading, Spanish literature, and writing.     \n\nI have more than ten years of teaching experience with children, youth and adults. I am patient, friendly, responsible and dedicated to my students' educational progress and enjoyment of learning. \n\nI graduated magna cum laude from Tufts University in 1991, completed advanced level Spanish studies at Academia Latinoamericana de Español in Ecuador in 2011 and earned my University of Cambridge CELTA ESL teaching certificate (TESOL) in 2012 at St. Giles International. I have lived, studied, volunteered and traveled in North and South America, Asia and Europe. \n\nI speak English, Spanish, some French, some Italian, and some Tibetan.\n\nHablo español y tengo una especialidad en la enseñanza de inglés a los hablantes nativos de español y castellaño. Por favor, escríbeme en español si usted prefiere. Ofrezco precios reducidos para hablantes de español. \n\nJe parle un peu de français, mais je peut lire et écrire le français mieux que je le peut parler. Si vous préférez, vous pouvez écrire et je peut répondre en français. \n\nIo capisco un po l'Italiano. \n\nDISCOUNTS for CLASSES in PACIFICA: I enjoy working with students in my own community. I offer a discounted rate of $60 PER HOUR to students who come to Pacifica for classes. Come to Pacifica for tutoring with an ocean view! (Mention *PACIFICA DISCOUNT*.) \n\nSCHOLARSHIPS: Please see the Special Needs section of profile for scholarship information. I also offer significantly reduced rates for foster-care/emancipated students and for international refugee students. \n\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

During Community College I did Spanish 1-4, getting an A in both Spanish 3 and 4. I also took an Ancient Greek intensive course at UC Berkeley and got an A-. I have years of tutoring experience in many subjects such as English, German, Spanish, Ancient Greek, as well as essay writing.\r\n\r\nI've studied multiple languages for several years and have done very well in all the language classes I've taken. I also provide my students with learning materials that explain complicated grammatical structures in simple graphs. Another thing I provide my students are good songs from the target language with lyric pages that have English translations on one side.\r\n\r\nI love teaching languages and have a lot of fun doing it. I've studied Spanish, German, Ancient Greek, in school and Latin and Biblical Hebrew on my own, so I know how to master a language from scratch. My focus in teaching a language is to have the student actually speak it and build on the parts of the language they can already speak. So I begin by giving the student a rudimentary conversational command of the language and then we build on that foundation through talking, listening, music, writing, and reading. I am also very good with pronunciation and so I know how to get my students sounding like native speakers.",

            "FreeResponse": "Hello,\n\nI'm a dynamic Spanish/ESL Teacher with nine years of experience teaching all ages and levels. I've worked with large groups, small groups, and given private lessons both for English and Spanish. I have TEFL certification, and I am fully bilingual (Spanish/English). I'm also a musical theatre trained actor. I have a BFA in Dance obtained at the University of the Americas in Mexico and have booked acting jobs in theatre, commercials, radio, and TV in Mexico City and Los Angeles.\n\nAfter graduating from college in 2007, I moved to Mexico City to pursue a career in the performing arts while teaching ESL in some of the best bilingual private schools in the country. I taught English as a foreign language in Mexico for five years at three different private schools where I taught large groups from 1st to 8th grades, I worked as a substitute professor at \"Universidad Autonoma de Baja California\" for one year. I had the opportunity to teach English as a Second Language to employees of an international manufacturing corporation as part of their training for one year, while I was also tutoring English and Spanish privately. \n\nFive years ago I moved to Los Angeles pursuing a further education in the Performing Arts. I completed a Musical Theatre certificate and started auditioning while interning at a boutique talent agency, which later got me into assisting in different casting agencies. During this time I realized how many more job opportunities there are for actors who speak more than one language, and with my experience in Speech, ESL, Spanish, IPA, acting, and now casting, I developed effective ways to help actors become bilingual, sharpen their pronunciation, or just be able to master a specific text for an audition. At the same time, for the past five years, I have been teaching English and Spanish to non-actors, both children, and adults. As well as doing some translation work for bilingual celebrities' social media.\n\nBesides the performing arts, I specialize in medical terminology teaching and translation.\n\nAs for my tutoring/teaching method, it varies depending on the student. I need to know my student's personality, goals, and previous training before establishing a plan of action. Not everybody is interested in the same things or learns the same way. I adapt my teaching according to each person to make the learning process both efficient and fun. \n\nSomething unique that I bring to my language teaching is an emphasis on phonetics (pronunciation). I've realized that most Spanish students have studied the language for years but don't feel confident actually speaking it in a real context. My training in IPA and accent reduction gave me the ability to not only notate, but identify, and produce sounds that are particular to each language. The correct placement of the tongue and lips; pitch; intonation; and breath are a few of the variables that can help my students achieve a native sound. It's amazing how their confidence boosts as soon as they start identifying and producing these sounds themselves!\n\nTwo years ago, I traveled to India to get certified as a Yoga teacher. I spent over a month in the world's capital of Yoga, Rishikesh, completing an intensive Yoga teacher training course with amazing and knowledgeable  traditional teachers. The tools that Yoga has provided me with are applicable not only to my daily life and personal relationships, but also to my performing, and teaching.\n\nLast year, I furthered my Yoga education by completing a Yoga for Kids certificate with Kidding Around Yoga with the amazing Haris Lender, as well as a Restorative Yoga Teacher Training with the wonderful and knowledgeable Amber Voiles. \n\nI love connecting with people, and I find tutoring and teaching very enriching, my favorite part of being a teacher is making a connection with the students, learning something new from every single one of them and, of course, watching my students' progress is the most satisfying feeling in the world!  I also enjoy the flexibility of the job, which allows me to combine it with acting. \n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me if you're looking for a tutor for yourself or your child(ren). I'd be happy to help!\n\nHappy learning and Namaste,\n\nMelisa",

            "FreeResponse": "Hi! My name is Alexandra and I graduated from Miami-Dade College with an AA in Language Education (Spanish & French), and I graduated from Florida International University in Miami, with a Cum Laude BFA in Sculpture and an Art History Minor. As a student myself, the teachers I most remember have been those who took the time to teach me based on my personal style of learning. That is possibly the main reason why I became a teacher and tutor to begin with! I have a passion for encouragement and have always felt that each human being has a unique style of learning, and that it is possible for any one student to master any difficult subject he/she comes across. I teach language in a fun engaging way through different methodologies I have learned throughout my teaching career. Overall, I am committed to the students' success by helping them grow in confidence whether learning another language, reading or any aspect of the arts.  Watching students discover their own abilities while taking pride in their accomplishments, is the part of teaching I love the most.  \r\n\r\nI have been a teacher and private tutor in Spanish and Art for a number of years (15+) I have also taught Reading Remediation, grades K-8, which gave me the opportunity to teach English, a language I love just as much as Spanish. This period in teaching Reading was very fulfilling for me because I worked with 8th graders who could not read, much less spell or get good grades in their other subjects. I would stay over time to help them, as well as their parents to learn English, encouraging them to learn as much as they could so they could move forward in life.  We read newspapers, went to the library, and etc...I worked in conjunction with their English teacher who began seeing improvement in the students who came to my class for an hour every other day. One of my greatest rewards in teaching was that year.  One of my very shy students who could not spell the simplest words at the beginning, brought an application to me one day, at the end of the year, to ask me for help in filling out an application to one of the top high schools because she now felt she could do so! And while I have had extensive training in many areas of teaching, language and art, including bronze foundry, welding, & blacksmithing, the greatest joy in my career is not being knowledgeable in all of this, but it is when I see students realize their full potential.  Aside from teaching and my personal work in art, I have been a Spanish Medical Interpreter/Translator for a number of years, which helps me directly in keeping up with my language of origin.  I am deeply committed to my work in every aspect, as well as dedicated to the pursuit of engaging and encouraging students not to give up, but to continue in their learning journey because they can.  \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions and/or would like to contact me, please do not hesitate to do so. I thank you, parent and student beforehand for the opportunity to work with you, and I look forward very much to meeting and helping you, the student, in your future learning endeavors. ",

            "FreeResponse": "My name is Bonnie and I have been a Spanish tutor since 2002.  I also earned my master's degree in Spanish from CSUF in May of 2012.  My first experience tutoring was as a volunteer in the Learning Assistance Program at Saddleback College.  I tutored there for about two years and since then I have tutored privately.  I also earned my teaching credential in 2009. I have experience tutoring students in all areas (reading and literature, writing, conversation, and vocabulary development).  With new students I typically start by assessing the areas in which they struggle most in order to provide specialized attention where it is needed most. I typically do this by both asking the student directly and then working on several assignments together.  For homework assignments and writing activities, I encourage students to write about topics that interest them.  This tends to be helpful, especially since for many students Spanish is a subject that is both boring and anxiety-producing.  This allows them to relax and have a little fun with the language while at the same time improving their skill level.  With time and practice I am confident that the students who choose me as a tutor will greatly improve their language skills in all areas.  I look forward to working with you!\n\nI have also tutored English as a Second Language for over ten years.  I started tutoring ESL in 2004 at UCLA in the English Conversation Program.  I ran small classes of about eight people and worked on improving conversation skills, grammar, vocabulary, and even slang.  While I was earning my teaching credential, I also taught an ESL class at a local high school.  It is always rewarding to watch students’ confidence grow throughout the semester as their English improves and this is why I love tutoring English as a Second Language! Please contact me if you want to improve your English. \n\nSoy tutora de inglés desde hace más de diez años. Empecé en el 2004 como tutora en el Programa de Conversación en inglés en UCLA. Enseñé clases pequeñas de ocho personas para mejorar la conversación, la gramática, el vocabulario, la escritura, la lectura, y hasta la jerga.  Además, mientras estudiaba para ser maestra, enseñé una clase de ESL en la secundaria.  Para mí, lo más gratificante de este trabajo es ver el aumento de confianza de mis estudiantes mientras van mejorando su inglés, y por eso ¡me encanta hacer tutoría en inglés! Por favor póngase en contacto conmigo si quiere mejorar su inglés.",

Throughout my teaching career, I have tutored individual students, especially those in high school and early college courses who wanted to increase their understanding of the language and improve their grades.\n\nMy love for the Spanish language, my time spent in Spain and Latin America and my  experience in teaching enable me to share my expertise with my students and help them improve their communication skills and enjoyment of learning another language.\n\nI work with each student to diagnose his or her learning style as well as strengths and weaknesses.  I integrate tips for memorization and study skills and how to improve pronunciation.  Most importantly, I try to inject the fun and challenge of broadening one's world view by learning another language.\n\nI try to be flexible with my time.  While I do have a 24-hour cancellation policy, I offer makeup classes. I have a quiet and comfortable study space in my home where I teach private lessons and group classes.  However, I am happy to travel to another location if that is more convenient for the student.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and helping you achieve success in your Spanish studies!",

            "FreeResponse": "Hello! My name is Jorge and I am a California native that came to the University of Iowa back in the 2012 Fall. I have decided to stay in Iowa because I absolutely love it here! I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Human Physiology in the Spring of 2016. While at Iowa, I took courses in other disciplines such as Art History, Spanish, Math and Music. I currently work as a scientist for a biotechnology company in Coralville. \n\nAlthough I am currently a scientist, I have returned to school in order to work on the Masters in Teaching at Iowa. I am working on endorsements in all the sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science and Physics). If there is enough time, I also plan on getting endorsed in Spanish. Becoming a high school Biology teacher will mix my love of science with helping others discover how interesting and fun science can be. \n\nI think there are three stages in which I tutor my students. At first, I like to offer a helping hand as much as possible. Even the most basic concepts may not necessarily need clarification, but reinforcement. This allows the student to immediately feel confident with their abilities. As the lesson progresses, I will allow the student to begin working independently. I hope the student finds comfort in knowing that it is okay to make a mistake since I’ll be there to help. In the final stage of the lesson, I would like the student to do all the work on their own with minimal to no assistance. I will help at the end to fix any errors. \n\nI am also a firm believer in positive reinforcement as a key component in tutoring. Having a positive outlook can make even the most daunting material appear a little less frightening. I really enjoy when students can do work by themselves after having some help. I strive for students to have that \"ah-ha\" moment when things start to click. In my opinion, mistakes are a crucial part of the learning process. Making mistakes during a session will help the student identify what a mistake may potentially look like and hopefully will have some insight on how to fix it. It is better to catch mistakes during the session instead of where it matters, like quizzes and exams. I try to stray away from negative comments when a student makes a mistake. I think instead of telling them they are wrong, I try to steer them in the proper direction and try to figure out why their initial response may not be the correct one.  \n\nIn terms of language courses, I am a Spanish native speaker and have taken courses at the University of Iowa to reinforce my skills. I possess no accent in either English or Spanish as I learned both languages simultaneously. I can read, write and speak in either language with full confidence. I often helped my colleagues with pronunciation as this can sometimes prove to be a difficult aspect in the Spanish language. When I was in high school, I took the Advanced Placement course in Spanish. After completion of the course, I took the AP exam and got a 4. This score allowed me to earn credit at the University of Iowa. Earning that credit allowed me to take courses in the Spanish department that were primarily meant for Spanish major and minor students. I was also fortunate enough to study abroad in Madrid Spain during the 2015 summer. While I was there, I took a course in Advanced Spanish Grammar as well as a course in European Art History. During that summer, I was immersed in the Spanish culture and language I believe this helped improve my already impeccable Spanish skills.",

My Spanish teacher partnered me with another student who, for the life of her, could not understand the grammar we were reviewing. As I began to explain, growing more confident as she exclaimed, \"Oh... okay...\" again and again, I realized that I was having fun. Explaining something to someone who doesn't understand, working through a million different wordings so they *finally* get it, listening to that eventual \"Ohhhhhh...\" when it clicks--there's nothing better.\n\nI studied Spanish Language and Literature with a minor in Asian Studies at Clark University. I got my Master's in the Art of Teaching from the same university, and I am fully certified to teach English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and Spanish. Since 2013, I have been designing and implementing original curriculum, creating engaging and interesting lesson plans, and teaching as many people as will listen to me.\n\nI've taught English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) at the high school level for four years. Helping my students adjust to life in their new country is one of my favorite aspects of my job! I taught Spanish at the high school level for two years, and I loved guiding my American students towards understanding a new language and culture.\n\nPlease contact me at any time and I will make my best effort to reach out to you as soon as possible.

            "FreeResponse": "Spanish class isn't enjoyable for everyone-- I'm here to help you pass it, maybe even love it. If you want to actually learn Spanish while acing your class, too, then that's great; we can do both! But I recognize not everyone loves (or even likes) Spanish; if you just need to know what the \"subjunctive verb tense\" is so you can keep your GPA up, I'm your guy! \n\nMy approach to tutoring is fairly laissez faire. I trust you to know what you want and need to work on-- I'm here to help you, not tell you what to do. Most of my students bring their homework or study guide to me, and I help them understand concepts and/or what their teacher is looking for.\n\nI've been studying Spanish for 10 years, and it's my one of my chief passions in life (along with linguistics, which I tutor as well!). I'm a fluent speaker, AND I've taken enough Spanish classes to know how to get you the A you deserve. I have experience living in a Spanish-only household; tutoring Spanish to high school and college students; taking oral, written, and national Spanish exams, and researching using Spanish-language sources.\n\nI come from a family of English graduates and published writers. I'm the best writer I know in my peer group, and I would describe myself as \"adroit\" at preparing for vocabulary testing, in English and Spanish. This, combined with my substantial knowledge of Greco-Latin, French, and Germanic etymological roots, permits me to help you find your writing voice in Spanish and/or English.\n\nA little about me: I truly love tutoring, both because I enjoy helping people, and because I always learn something from my students. I am currently finishing a BA in Spanish Linguistics at the Barrett Honors College at ASU.",

I'm a native Spanish speaker, fluent in English and French. \n\nI not only like to teach the language, but to transmit some of the cultural values and experiences I acquired during my travels and time living in different countries. It is important for the students to understand that the best way to learn a new language is to understand also the culture.  Spanish is a very rich language, but over the time I learned that do not matter what your level is or for what reason you need to learn or improve it, never is too late to start.\n\nMy undergraduate degree is from the Universidad Catolica Andres Bello in Caracas, Venezuela and my Phd Doctor in Biology Studies from Washington State University. I was a full time Professor for the Dental School at Universidad Santa Maria in Caracas, Venezuela, for over 10 years teaching Biology for the Medicine students on their first and second year. I tutored on the side to help students struggling with language (international students) and/or Biology topics.\n\nOver the last 20 years I helped international students to achieve their academic goals in Science and Languages including Spanish proficiency at all levels. I enjoy what I do and my goal is for you to feel confident with your language skills and be able to communicate in Spanish at all levels. Your success is my success.\n\nSpanish - Native Speaker - South America and Spain\nBiology Professor (Phd)\nBiochemistry Professor\n\nOver 15+ years on higher education in South America helping students to achieve their academic goals in Science and Languages studies.

I'm also highly qualified in teaching Math and Physics which I am able to transmit successfully to the student. I'm very intuitive when assessing whether a student is understanding or not, as well as changing and adapting my teaching approach and method so that students can relate with the subject, gain interest in it and experience the satisfaction of learning after understanding the subject in matter. All this in a disciplined and responsible environment but with enough flexibility so that the student won't felt blocked by a tense and pressured learning environment.\n\nAs a Venezuelan native, I'm fluent in writing and speaking in Spanish and hence would be the perfect choice for tutoring Spanish at any level and for lots of purposes. My degree in Chemistry involves writing a big number of lab reports, papers and talks, which are both very technical and have to be done with the highest standards of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, etc. I served for 2 years as the National Communication & Information Coordinator for the Sri Sathya Sai Organization in Venezuela, which demanded top quality standards in using Spanish language in the most appropriate and proper way. I am always eager to improve my skills and to keep myself updated with the latest rules from the Royal Academy of Spanish Language.",

When I see that AHA! look on a student's face, I get as much pleasure from it as the student does! \n\nWhether I am teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) to people from other countries, Spanish to English speaking students, or citizenship/naturalization preparation skills,  the main goal is to help them feel the thrill of success. A large part of what I do with my students is to help them learn how to approach learning the language, and to realize that they really can do it! Once they get over the hurdle of doubt, we are on our way!\n\nI taught Spanish 1 through senior levels at a private high school, and have had fun tutoring high school and college level Spanish. I loved Spanish in high school, spent a summer as an exchange student in El Salvador speaking Spanish constantly, and earned my BA in Spanish at Rutgers Univ. It is delightful to see my tutoring students pull up their grades and feel proud of their accomplishments. \n\nI became certified to teach English as a Second Language (ESL), and in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL), and it is so much FUN! I have students from many different countries in my community college continuing education ESL classes. I get the chance to be silly and act out what I want to help my students learn, and we laugh a great deal in my classes. It is so rewarding to see my students learn enough English to get their first jobs in America! They feel very empowered! \n\nI also help college level ESL students understand their course work in writing their term papers which I proofread for grammar and readability.\n\nAs a language and cultural consultant, and as a former corporate trainer, I find it fun and challenging to work with foreign executives at corporations to help them upgrade their English skills at work. Helping their spouses acclimate to their new surroundings and engage in their new communities is both fun and rewarding on a personal level. \n\nIt brings me great joy to work with people who want to become American citizens. It is an honor to help them with the civics questions and English language preparations for the naturalization interview and test. I admire their dedication and hard work as they approach the realization of their dream to become citizens, and it is a wonderful experience for me to help them make that dream come true!",

As a high school student I always had a love of foreign languages and I studied both Spanish and French. As a junior I competed in statewide Spanish competitions and I became a member of both the National and National Spanish Honor Societies. Upon entering college, I decided early on upon a Spanish major and I graduated Magna Cum Laude having written a thesis on Latinos in the United States that earned an A grade. It was during my college years that I became a true aficionado of both Hispanic, Latino, and Latin American cultures and history. While in school I was a member of many Latino socio-cultural groups.\n\nSome years later I decided to pursue a graduate degree and I first worked as a teacher's assistant for one year before I became a graduate student where I continued to teach and tutor college students. It was during this time that I began to study Portuguese grammar and literature. After earning my masters degree, I decided to continue my education and studied to receive my doctorate in Spanish and Portuguese Literatures and Cultures. During this time I taught and tutored students for six years and I improved my Portuguese skills to become proficient at teaching introductory Portuguese grammar. \n\nSome of the aspects I love most about tutoring are seeing students learn more about themselves through language and culture, seeing their confidence improve as they harness their communication skills and seeing their potential unfold as they discover new career and travel options after having studied\n\nI am an outstanding language tutor because I am patient, I have skills to help students with difficult concepts, and I value my students' success.\n\nAre you ready to see your language skills take flight?  If so, set up an appointment and we will begin to work together to help you achieve your goals.",

When I returned to the U.S., I began teaching English as a volunteer. Based on my own experiences abroad, I first taught a workshop for speaking on the telephone, and quickly moved on to provide individual tutoring.\n\nI have since learned a number of other languages, including Arabic, Uzbek, Slovene, and a smattering of German, Italian, Russian, Portuguese, French. However, my fluency in Spanish is near-native proficiency, given to having lived and worked in Latin America for six years.\n\nAll told, I have a solid understanding of what it takes to learn and master a foreign language, and many years of experience helping others to reach their goals.\n\nI have been teaching English in Latin America, as well as providing translating and proofreading services in both English and Spanish, for the last five years.  I am currently preparing for the C2 level DELE exam, the highest level of certification available for Spanish. \n\nI look forward to helping you to reach your goals, be it in perfecting your English, or moving beyond your high school Spanish classes so that you can feel comfortable working in your field abroad, or traveling off the beaten path.",

I use a variety of methods from using visuals, grammar tricks, fun activities and making my students feel confident in their target language either English or Spanish. I am very proud that I can make my students feel comfortable with the level of Spanish/English they need to know for school/work/leisure.  I have lived first hand experience why Spanish is so important and fun. I will pass that on to your child and help make them excited about learning Spanish. I have also taught a variety of conversation classes. I know how to make you feel confident about communicating in a second language and these classes tend to be more geared towards adults.

It was a great experience which led me to obtain my Operations Research & Industrial Engineering degree from Cornell University.  It wasn't an easy road to get to because it took lots of hard work and persistence.  It made me a better person for it.  Since my parents are Ecuadorian, I spoke only Spanish until I went to kindergarten.  Then, I became bilingual.  My parents always encouraged me to speak, read and write in Spanish.  They understood that knowing more than one language would be essential in the future.  Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the US.  Throughout my academic and professional careers, I have had the good fortune of having tutors/mentors help me achieve my goals.\n  \nI would like the opportunity pay it forward by helping students who are struggling in math and Spanish achieve their goals.

I am a recent graduate from the University of Connecticut with a Chemistry degree,a concentration in Mathematics and Molecular Cell Biology. I have received multiple research fellowships from my department including fellowships in Shanghai, China at Fudan University and in Panama at  INDICASAT laboratory. In my university, I was a mentor to freshmen and transfer students through the METAS program where I was contacted by many of my peers to tutor their students in General Chemistry 1127 and 1128. Through the INDICASAT institute, I was responsible for teaching high school students from Balboa Academy about laboratory techniques such as ELISA, rodent manipulation, Western Blotting, etc. These, at the end of their internship, would have to present their acquired knowledge to their respective private investigators.\r\n\r\nI do enjoy tutoring whether it be theoretical concepts in math or chemistry as described in my profile as well as laboratory techniques. \r\n\r\nI enjoy tutoring given that I receive the opportunity of teaching my students a different outlook or perspective when looking at problems in their homeworks. It also gives me the opportunity to get to know on a personal basis my student and learn the strengths and weaknesses at a faster rate as opposed to a regular classroom setting. \r\n\r\nI have been required by my major to take multiple classes in Mathematics including but not limited to Mutivariable Calculus , Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Differential Geometry, Complex Variable. Given my background and research experience where abstract mathematics is required makes me a qualified as a tutor. \r\n\r\nI wanted to reiterate that my main domains of study are chemistry and molecular and cell biology not only having experience in an academic setting but also as a research fellow in charge of multiple undergraduates as well as high school students teaching them theoretical and laboratory lessons through real live scenarios or research dilemmas. \r\nMy goal is for you the student to not be intimidated by the sciences but rather embrace your innate curiousity. \r\n\r\nI wanted to assure the students looking for help to not be discouraged. With a positive and dedicated attitude, one can achieve the intended goal and enjoy the pursuit as well. I am here to help you get your \"aha\" moment but without the toil or dedication and practice on both ends,  we cannot savor the joy of the results. Therefore, I want to be clear that the commitment must come from us both. \r\nIf you're interested, I will be honored to be the one to help you in your pursuit. \r\n\r\n",

            "FreeResponse": "After being trained in standardized test instruction by Kaplan (the leading test prep company), I have logged over 2,000 hours as a tutor over the last three years.  In addition to tutoring, I teach Philosophy as an adjunct professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg and at Christendom College in Front Royal, Virginia.\n\nThe students who come to me for help with the SAT, ACT, ASVAB, GRE, or GED are taught the same test-preparation and test-taking techniques that I used myself to score 780 math/770 verbal on the SAT, and to earn perfect scores (800s) on the GRE math and verbal. I also tutor in Math, Physics, Chemistry, English, Latin, Spanish, and Writing for middle school, high school, and college.\n\nWhether a student is looking for help with algebra equations or with the SAT writing section, I always begin by identifying the areas in which the student needs to improve (by means of practice tests and conversation with the student), so that we can focus our time on strengthening these weaknesses from the very first lesson. By assigning challenging homework and reviewing it at the student’s own pace, I ensure that he or she makes steady progress without being overwhelmed.\n\nStudents who meet with me in groups receive a substantial discount--every student after the first one only pays half my regular rate.\n\nSince my only goal is to help you achieve yours, I do not bill for any lesson with which the student or parent is not entirely satisfied, and I frequently ask for feedback.\n\nMy schedule is flexible, so I try to accommodate the student's schedule as much as possible. I prefer to meet in group study rooms that I reserve at the downtown Fredericksburg library, England Run Library, and Salem Church Library since these are optimal places to get a lot of work done together, but I am open to other locations that are more convenient for the student.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you, and to working with you!",

I currently tutor in reading, Spanish and  English Language learners. I can work effectively with small groups creating a friendly environment. I feel satisfaction by teaching people from different cultural backgrounds. When I am not tutoring I am dancing, a hobby that keeps me connected with my Latin roots; I always take time for reading, to be aware of what is going on in the present or what happened in the past.

I've been studying Spanish for nearly 20 years and minored in it in college. I've studied Arabic for 8 years (B.A. & M.A. in Arabic Studies) and lived in Egypt for nearly 3 years. This experience and education gives an advantage to not only pass what I know in these languages on but to understand the journey that second language learners experience. \n\nI first worked with ESL students by volunteering at my university's ESL programs as a language tutor ( meeting international students a few times a week giving them the opportunity to practice conversational and Standard English and  to become acclimated with American culture). \nDuring my graduate studies and after, I volunteered at non-profit organizations teaching and assisting teachers in ESL to refugees. \n\n Learning a different language is in no way easy. It requires patience,  practice,  and creativity both for teaching and learning it. I promise to exhibit and exalt this while tutoring wherever I go. It brings me great joy to see a student of any field / subject master and get to the next level in it.\n\n I look forward to this with my students.

            "FreeResponse": "I am a passionate educator and multi-lingual native of Concord, MA. I first fell in love with the Spanish language thanks to a series of amazing teachers I had. Later I fell in love with Spain where I lived for over eight years. It was wanting to live in Spain that hurdled me into teaching, but there I discovered it is my calling. I taught elementary English, science, physical education and art all in English to Spaniards. Later I was the head 4th grade teacher in a bilingual school for main English subjects. All the while, I tutored students of all ages and levels. I loved helping people build confidence in their language skills, especially oral expression.\r\n\r\nOnce back in Massachusetts, I earned my teacher certification for K-12 Spanish and currently work as a high school teacher. Imparting cultural knowledge as well as new slang and helping students find a way to connect with Spanish in creative ways are my specialities. Are you looking to become fluent? I'm proof it's possible and I can get you there. Are you hoping to improve your grades? I can guide you there through the best path for you. Are you looking to practice previously acquired skills? I love to chat in Spanish as well.\r\n\r\nI have years of experience working with non-native English students of all ages and levels. I have done test prep classes for both TOEFL and TOEIC certification. I have always had a knack for languages and am a self-proclaimed language nerd. I also understand different people learn different ways and can adjust accordingly. I am fluent in Spanish and would love to help you achieve your goals in the language, whatever they may be.\r\n\r\nThe story goes that at 4 years old I used to sit and watch kids on the playground do things many times before I tried. Always getting closer to see just how things were done before jumping in. Once successfully completing the task, I would coach timid or reluctant kids to participate. I could always break down task into small manageable steps, and foresee potential pitfalls or doubts. I have always been a teacher, I just didn't find out until my 20s.\r\n\r\nContact me to help me walk you through the steps needed to succeed in your language acquisition. I promise it'll be fun!",

We will also work hard on pronunciation, so you feel confident when you speak.\nIf a student need support at school, I follow the lessons I am presented with, and prepare exercises to reinforce them. And then...speak, speak and speak more Spanish.  I always take into account the students' interests and expectations, so I can prepare useful classes. I like to hear how they want to work.\nI love tutoring when I can see progress and confidence as a feedback.

            "FreeResponse": "Hello there,\n\nI decided to become a Wyzant tutor because I love explaining things to people, anything that I have  good knowledge of, especially academic material. While my favorite age group to work with is children, I have also had the joy of working with people of all different age groups, including teenagers, adults and senior citizens. \n\nAs a tutor, I work both with students who struggle to understand school material and students who want to get ahead or learn something out of personal enjoyment. I find that anytime someone is new to an idea or struggling academically, it's best to relate the material to them in a concrete terms to make the matter clear. As students become familiar with a topic, they are able to make connections to new ideas more easily and they start to feel more comfortable with material that was once difficult. This also enables them to move on to more challenging problems and even make connections on their own, without assistance. It is my goal is to help all of my students reach their intellectual potential and become self-directed learners. \n\nWhenever I start to work with a student, first I find the current level of difficulty that he or she can work at, and I start by helping them at that point. If the student has a hard time understanding the material one way, I look for a different way to explain it to them so that he or she can understand the concepts in a way that is easy for them. I love to give students the tools to work through questions in a way that makes it simple for them to understand what they need to do, how to work through the curriculum and the reasoning behind every question. I would be happy to do the same for you!",

            "FreeResponse": "Hey everyone my name is AnaLau. I graduated from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in 2013. I majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry and Medical Spanish. Yes, I speak spanish. Matter of fact, it is my first language and even though I have been in the US for 10+ years I practice every single day. I am very thorough about not forgetting how to speak/write spanish properly and I think I have done an excellent job. I do have experience teaching, my last year before graduating I was hired by my university as a laboratory assistant. I would teach biology to a wide age range, students from 17-56 years. This part of class was a lot more visual which would help a lot of them in their lecture classes when it came to exams. I was a student myself at the time so I understood their struggles as I had been through them too. I became a mentor to a couple of my students which I still to this day communicate with.  I enjoy teaching students with passion, commitment and overall wanting to succeed. I think I would identify with many of you because I'm not you average tutor. I consider myself a smart individual but  sometimes I also struggled to find a way of studying that would best fit me and at times I was ready to give up. Through tutoring and mentors I was able to engage in a way of life that benefited and helped me get better grades in my classes. I want to help you ease your worry as well as help you learn. Trust me when I say that knowledge that is in your head is yours forever, everything you accomplish, no one will ever be able to take it away from you. Lets all get wiser together and succeed in our careers. \n\nI am currently applying for podiatry schools and studying for my MCAT on my free time. Like you, I also have a tutor and mentor specifically for this and it has helped me to at least stay on track. Having a tutor and mentor works! Hopefully soon I will give you all the good news that I have been accepted. \n\nI taught Biology for 1 year and even though this class was a lot more visual, I had to lecture and then show my students what I was talking about. Since this class was visual and hands-on many of my students understood lecture much better after coming to my class. \nAnatomy is my favorite subject and was very good at it. I'm sure I can show you some tricks about acing this class.\nFor ecology, I had a mentor who's specialty was in ecology and global warming change. I started doing some research with this professor for 3 years and eventually after I graduated I stayed on board and was working in two projects with her. One project made the news and the other project were worked on together was published in a magazine called parasites and vectors. \n\nI was born in Mexico and I am first generation to attend school in the US. I have practiced both languages since the age of 6, I would live in Mexico and everyday my mother would bring me to school in the US. I am the only one in my family that can speak both languages fluently. I really didn't have much choice since both of my parents don't speak english. My father is very meticulous in the way I write and speak spanish and has made  sure I am always on top of my game. I think I have a higher vocabulary and proficiency in Spanish than in English just because it is the language that I use most daily.\n\nI am a very meticulous when it comes to writing skills. I think the fact that English isn't my first language is was makes me have a hawk eye for mistakes when it comes to proofreading essays.  \n\nIf there is anything else you would like to know about me, ask away! I'm here to help grow as a student and share my experiences as a student with you so I can direct you into a better path, sure I wish I had someone guiding me.",

I am currently the middle school & high school Spanish teacher at a private school in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nI have traveled to many Spanish speaking countries, living in Spain for several months, and completing my four-month student teaching experience in Quito, Ecuador. I've spent several weeks in Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia as well, to learn the culture and improve my language skills as a translator.\n\nIn the Grand Rapids area, I have volunteered at Forest Hills Public Schools, NorthPointe Christian Elementary, and NorthPointe Christian High School. I have also completed internships in several schools systems in the Dayton, Ohio area. I look forward to work as a Spanish teacher at Northside Christian Schools in Columbus Ohio for the years to come!\n\nWorking with young language learners as well as their parents to help students learn to communicate better in Spanish as well as learn about Spanish culture is what I absolutely love to do. I prefer to tutor for conversational (practical-use) Spanish, but am also qualified and willing to assist students as they take a Spanish course and work on grammar, writing, etc. I also specialize in teaching History and Literature of Spain if that is of interest as well.\n\nI typically teach immersion-style (all Spanish with no English), but am totally willing to talk this over with students with lower levels of Spanish. As a high school teacher, I enjoy using a lot of hands-on activities that work well for kinesthetic, visual, as well as audio learners. For each tutoring period, we typically work on all four modes of communication (listening, speaking, reading, writing), but we will focus on whichever needs the most improvement or whichever your prefer. \n\nI look forward hearing from you soon!\nSra.

My career allowed me to travel to many Spanish- speaking countries, so I could better understand the specifics of the language in each country.\nAs Spanish teacher I focus on the needs of each student and I develop my classes with this in mind. I work on developing the four basic skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. I also pay special attention to grammar because it is essential to learn Spanish. The Spanish language is spoken in many countries of different cultures, so I also discuss historical and cultural themes in my classes.\nI can offer a free consultation by email before starting the lessons. I can be flexible with my time. While I do have a 24-hour cancellation policy, I offer makeup classes. \nI can teach private lessons or group classes. I prefer teaching at cafes or libraries. \nI look forward to hearing from you and helping you achieve success in your Spanish studies!!",

In addition to a flexible tutoring schedule, I currently teach Spanish and Art to grades Pre K thru 8 and have subbed for several Monmouth County school districts. In the meantime, I'm busy raising my teenage son and working toward obtaining a master's degree.\n\nThanks to a strong grasp of grammar in both English and foreign languages I have tutored ESL and Adult Education students at Brookdale Community College, grade school and high school students, bilingual children and adults, children classified with the No Child Left Behind program, and small business groups.\n\nI WORK EQUALLY WELL WITH NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS OF ANY AGE OR GRADE LEVEL. I've worked with people from Central and South America, Europe and Asia, AS WELL AS native English-speaking Americans who have trouble with reading, writing, weak grammar skills, etc.   \n\nWhether you're falling behind in school, need help with exams or simply want to improve your language skills, I can help! Together we can work on and improve:\n    * common pronunciation and grammatical errors \n    * auditory and reading comprehension \n    * verbal and written communication \n    * school exams and GED \n    * essays and term-papers \n    * preparation for U.S. Citizenship interview and exam \n\nNot everyone learns in the same way or at the same pace, so individual tutoring sessions are planned with your personal needs in mind. Group tutoring is also available; rates vary slightly and are available upon request. \n \nMy educational background includes foreign language study in Spanish, Italian and French, as well as Graphic Design at Pratt Institute of Art. Ultimately both specialties were combined toward a B.A. degree in Humanities. Academic accolades include: The Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship for study abroad at Universidad Catolica (Guayaquil, Ecuador), Dean's list, several Outstanding Achievement Awards, and other grants. \n \nFeel free to contact me to discuss how we can personalize tutoring classes to fit YOUR needs today.

In addition to saving time and money for you, it helps me to effectively prepare by getting a better idea of your personal needs and difficulties. Meeting once, prior to an actual session, is offered at no cost or obligation. \n\n**PLEASE ALSO NOTE: WyzAnt requires a form of payment be submitted prior to the exchange of phone #'s or addresses for meeting.

I currently have my preliminary teacher’s certification to teach Spanish and History in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nSpanish\r\n\r\nI believe that my unique life and academic experiences make me an excellent Spanish tutor. I learned Spanish as a second language, so I understand the difficulties that English speakers have when learning the language, and some simple things that can help them. I also have had the opportunity to speak with Spanish speakers  throughout the Spanish Speaking World, so if you are planning a trip to a particular place, I can cater to your needs. I feel that my ability to figure out what a student’s weakness is one my best attributes as a tutor.\r\n\r\nESL\r\n\r\nI have worked as an ESL teacher at nights, and have a lot of experience dealing with English speakers who are Spanish speakers. I also have a great interest in other languages, and I believe that knowing a little bit about someone's own language can help me tutor someone with English.

I really enjoy history and I bring that enthusiasm to my tutoring.\r\n\r\nPortuguese \r\n\r\nWhile living in Europe, I had the opportunity to study Portuguese, and had exposure to both European and Brazilian Portuguese. I am more familiar with Brazilian Portuguese, but I am familiar with European Portuguese too. I also have a good understanding of the hurdles that a Spanish or English speaker will encounter while learning Portuguese.  \r\n\r\nItalian\r\n\r\nDue to my family background, I always have had a great interest in Italian language and culture. Using my knowledge of Italian, I was able to find my grandparent’s family in Italy and visit their town and surviving cousins.

Throughout college, I served as a tutor in Biology, Psychology, English, and SAT prep. As a Horace Mann High School student, I also previously tutored Riverdale residents. My years of experience have taught me how to be flexible and how to adapt to individual student needs.\n\nMy goal is to provide the academic support essential for you to excel in your coursework, to connect you to the appropriate resources, and to encourage consistent engagement with the subject. I create a safe space in which you are encouraged to ask questions, to think critically, and to problem solve. By identifying and addressing weak points of understanding, I will work to teach you how to break down difficult problems into understandable solutions. I look forward to challenging your understanding of your coursework and equipping you with the fundamental building blocks necessary for you to master the material.\n\nPsychology: I received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at Columbia University in The City of New York. My area of focus includes The Unconscious Mind, Social Cognition and Emotion, Social Personality and Development, and Behavior. I look forward to sharing the study methods and learning techniques that led me to success.\n\nBiology: I completed the Pre-Medical student requirements including Biology, Physics, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and all accompanying labs. As a tutor, I apply the in-depth knowledge that I have accumulated through these college courses (and through subsequent work experience as a research assistant in Columbia's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and Neurobiology Laboratories).\n\nEnglish: In college, I excelled in my English courses, including Literature Humanities I & II, Contemporary Civilizations I & II, and University Writing. I have served as an editor, columnist, and writing tutor for both The Journal of Global Health and Model Congress' Political Magazine.\nI work with both students and professionals, writing and editing a wide range of subjects (traditional English essays, reviews, scientific publications, lab reports, etc). I also work with students to strengthen grammar, to build vocabulary, and to expand understanding of the English language. By working with literary text, I teach students how to pick out key themes, to engage in active discussion about the plot, and to analyze the development of characters. My background is primarily English and Spanish.\n\nSummary: My primary focus is to open up your understanding of the subject so that you may develop a love for learning.

I teach math, among other subjects, online to bring in some extra income. \n\nI've personally always enjoyed school even though it was oftentimes a great source of stress for me and still is for countless other students. Exams often made me feel queasy, but I'd always look forward to them with great anticipation because I was prepared, and I knew I could conquer that test. A few times, the test conquered me, but I knew a sheet of paper or a blue book could not define who I was nor what I was capable of doing. A less than satisfactory test score just gave me further reason to try harder, study better, and be faster, stronger the next time.\n\nNever in my academic career have I ever pulled an all-nighter. I never had to because I believed that self-discipline, good preparation, a healthy social life, and a regular sleep schedule would best condition my brain for success. \n\nMy goal is to prepare the student well, whether it be for a test, a final exam, or for a trip abroad to an English or Spanish speaking country. With two years of experience tutoring ONLINE, I have facility with Skype and with WyzAnt's excellent online tutoring platform, of which my favorite feature is their virtual online whiteboard that allows for document uploading and real-time interaction between tutor and student.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you are interested in online tutoring for your student as an affordable and effective aide to academic success.",

That's why, I always do my best to pass all of this on to my students in an enjoyable and relaxed manner.\n\nThat's why my goals are:\n- To pass on my French language knowledge and know-how onto students.\n- To exceed expectations and show positive results.\n- To ensure that all my students expand their knowledge and learning abilities. \n\nI enjoy teaching students at any age, and helping them build confidence in order to enable them to succeed academically and socially.\n\nI am an extremely active and keen person specializing in French and Ancient History.

I have experience in teaching language and culture courses and integrating instructional technology and social media in classroom.  In each teaching position I have held, I have been a popular instructor. My courses always filled up quickly as students enjoyed my teaching style.  I believe that it’s important to use authentic documents with meaningful content so that learners are motivated to learn. This approach is to actively teach content-specific language while providing ample opportunities for students to use that language both in meaningful class discussion and in writing. Thus, by giving the opportunity for input, students generate ideas and set goals that make for much richer activities than compliment my own ideas. When students have ownership in the curriculum, they are motivated to work hard and master the skills necessary to reach their goals. \n\nAssessment: \n\nExcellent achievement:\n- Received 100% positive feedback from my students in each position I have held.\n- Additionally 100% of my students who took the DELF,TCF and DFP affaires tests of CIEP ( institution of the French Ministry of National Education) successfully passed with honors.\n\nWhy should I be selected?\n\n\n- Specialized in phonetics and oral & written didactic.\n- Tutoring, teaching, and monitoring experience in teaching French Language&Culture. \n- Comprehensive understanding of the skills needed to cover a wide range of student abilities.\n- Commitment to each individual student to enhance/ develop linguistic competency in French for the four core abilities: reading, writing, listening and speaking.. \n- Provide tutorial assistance to students studying all levels of French, assist with assigned homework.\n- Prepare exercises designed to make the sessions interesting and educational, including thought provoking quizzes and substitution drills, geared towards helping my students to comprehend and memorize material.\n- Can prepare you to take any French proficiency test with successful result: \nFor examples: the SAT in French ; the DILF-DALF-DELF at all levels (from A1 to C2) on the competency scale defined by the Council of Europe (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages administered by the Centre international d'etude pedagogiques ( CIEP); Or/and the TCF Test de connaissance du français designed by the CIEP and awarded by the French Ministry of Education\n; or/and The DPF Affaires with the Chamber of Commerce of Paris.\n\n\nStrengths:\n- Can formulate efficient teaching programs to make students more focused.\n- Devised methods of quickly improving French language students grasp of the basics. \n- Meticulous in my approach to work. \n- Patient and approachable teaching manner that meets students’ individual and group needs.",

            "FreeResponse": "I had the privilege of living in Spain for thirteen years of my adult life with the number one job description for the first year being to learn the language. The rest of that time we lived and worked with the local people and were not around English speakers. So while English is my first language, I had plenty of time to learn Spanish and lived in the environment long enough to become very comfortable with that language and culture. Also, I am involved with Spanish speaking people in the area on a weekly basis in my church and also in translating for services there. This group of people in my church are from around fifteen different Spanish speaking countries in Latin and South America, and we have no difficulties in communicating with each other. \n\nAfter returning to the United States, I went back to school and majored in Spanish and became a high school Spanish teacher. While completing my degree, I substitute taught for 3 years in Spanish classrooms in the school district where I live. I noticed that sometimes there was a high level of frustration between student and teacher when the teacher was from another country, and their Spanish was stronger than their English. They would have difficulty understanding or explaining a concept because of being weak in English grammmar or having difficulty in understanding the struggles the English speakers were having in comparison to Spanish. This was not a problem for me, since I struggled with some of those same issues.\n\nAfter teaching one year in a public high school, I switched to a private college prep academy for the next eight years, where I could focus on the students and improving my skills in teaching the language. After that I took a year off to substitute teach and then was invited to teach at Riverwood Middle School, which I have done for the past 4 years. \n\nNow I am opting for a more flexible schedule this year in order to have more time with aging parents, kids and grandchildren. \n\nIn tutoring, I can assist my students in the textbook they are using at school and help them to be prepared for the next class day. Since I have taught all the grammar in Spanish I, II, and III, I also use various tools and visuals and techniques to make these concepts easier to grasp for the student who struggles. \n\nI realize that foreign languages are easier for some students than for others and will work with each student to find ways that work for them to get through the difficult parts.",

Depending on those factors we determine what area we need to focus on more and which methods or techniques will be most effective.\n\nI've helped students in many different ways like getting into prestigious schools, passing a test, feeling more confident to express themselves, improving their fluency, expanding their vocabulary, understanding grammar and achieving good conversational skills.\n\nLessons focus on conversation; they also include vocabulary, grammar, reading, comprehension, writing, speaking, listening and pronunciation (accent reduction). \n\nI create a positive and supportive environment that will engage students and encourage them to stay focused and motivated but at the same time remain appropriately challenged. I am reliable, responsible and very dedicated to the learning process of each individual. \n\nLessons online or in person at home, at work or at a public place.\nFeel free to contact me with any additional questions or to schedule a lesson!",

Additionally, I studied abroad in 2016 in Spain. I also have experience using Spanish as a co-worker at Chula Vista resort, working alongside many native Spanish speakers.\n \nFurthermore, I also work as a Personal Trainer and am an American Council Exercise Certified Personal Trainer and Certified Health Coach. \n\nI am very passionate about tutoring and love the results that come from the one-on-one help.

I also received a Master's in International Relations and a Minor in East Asian Studies from Sogang University in Seoul, S. Korea. It was during my time in Korea, that I found a love for teaching and helping others. I learned how to listen and be patient with my students. I found it exciting trying to find which approach each student responded to in order to help them understand. \nI lived in South Korea for 7 years where I traveled, studied and taught. During my time in Korea, I worked with all levels of students from pre-k to company executives. I covered various subjects from ESL, TOEFL Test-prep reading and writing courses, business English, and various core subjects. As a student, I had the opportunity to help other graduate students write essays, prepare for tests and give scholarly presentations. Along the way, I also learned many valuable teaching, listening, and communication skills.   \n\nI fell in love with traveling and meeting people from different countries with different cultures. \nTutoring allows me to help others achieve their goals. By helping someone learn, it is giving them confidence that can open up new possibilities. I like to tailor each class depending on the individual, having one-on-one classes allows me to really focus on what works best for the student. I am open to any feedback or suggestions that the student or parent may have and together we can succeed. \n\nWith my experience traveling, working, and living abroad, I have developed a patience for learning new things. I understand that it takes time and a guidance. Learning a new language or a new place is difficult but once you gain confidence everything falls into place. I like to help find and build that confidence for my students to succeed! I am easy to reach so feel free to contact me with any questions you may have or to set up an appointment!!",

            "FreeResponse": "I am certified in ALL sciences, Math, ESOL, Italian, Spanish, and Special Education with a focus on my fields, as well as trained in AP Environmental Science, Handwriting Without Tears curriculum, and Wilson Reading System. I have been tutoring independently since 1997 and loved it so much that I eventually left my research path to focus on teaching instead. After completing my graduate coursework at UGA in 2011, I started teaching for a local school district and, when the opportunity arose, I transitioned to the role of Math and Science interventionist and to consulting independently, providing individualized support and guidance to students and their families in the Atlanta metro area (and even beyond, through the modern marvel of web conferencing!). I have accepted both private and institutional assignments and I pride myself with the repeat requests I receive to conduct standardised testing remediation and preparation classes, coaching for the entrance tests required by various professional programs (UG, Graduate), ESOL proficiency, and more. My forte is the ability to identify my students strength and weaknesses and then draw from their everyday life experiences to help them visualize the concepts on which they struggle. No subject is too complex to be explained with a few old time resources, tools, or memories. And no example is too trivial if it serves its purpose...Helping my student experience understanding and be as successful in their studies! HOW DO I STRUCTURE MY SESSIONS? The short version is that I \"sort of teach\", you should think of me as a cross between a coach, a tutor, and an educational therapist (there is such a thing and I'm actually preparing to return to grad school to complete the work I will need to become one.). In a perfect world, when I start working with new students, I observe, ask lots (and lots) of questions, try and figure out what is working, what isn't and why, brainstorm with them on the information I have gathered, then offer a few alternatives (some pretty crazy/out of the box but usually/hopefully fun ones!) that we can try together to find ways to overcome the obstacles at hand. My next step is to model those strategies for them, practice them together to make sure they will help in our circumstances, then-little by little-shift to overseeing them as they work independently. Our work together follows an arch. There is a beginning: when we meet and flesh out the students circumstances and needs). A climb: when we work together to overcome those. And there is an end: when we part ways and I leave them with a set of tools they can now apply to various settings, subjects, situations. HOW DO I DETERMINE MY RATES? My hourly rate is determined starting from the posted rate and adjusting up or down based on the individual arrangement made with each client RE duration and location of our meetings: \na. for lessons held at my location in Vinings $50/hr.\nb. $60/hr when I have to travel to a location ITP AND up to 30m travel each way. c. $70/hr to a location OTP  and/or up to 45m travel each way.\nd. 2 hr minimum required for locations that entail over 45m of travelling time. The visit can be split b/w 2 or more consecutive students (regardless to whether they are related) and/or be a semiprivate or small group (example homeschooling groups). d. Semiprivate & small group: base rate (see above) + $10/each student. In this case, students may decide to \"go Dutch\" and submit separate payments for their individual portion or designate one payer that THEY will reimburse. As you can see, the best way for my students to be able to control costs but still receive each and every one of the benefits of my help is for us to hold our lessons at my location (or on line using WyZant's platform!). This is because any time I have to travel off-site, I have to build the costs for the use of my vehicle and the travel time to and back to you... In other words: by coming to me, you only pay for the face-to-face time while, if we have to meet off site (3rd party or at your location), we are going to have to \"split those costs\" resulting on a higher rate for you. DO YOU REQUIRE A CANCELLATION NOTICE? I do require a 24HR CANCELLATION NOTICE in order not to charge the student the CANCELLATION/NO SHOW FEE (=1Hr @student's current rate). On a case by case basis, I may waive this fee (#Snowmageddon, #BridgeCollapse anyone?) OR in case of repeat late cancellations and/or no shows assess the full charge (actual scheduled time). While I do not take any pleasure in doing this (I love what I do!), the 24hrs notice allows me to release that time to my other students and often rebook it (about 1/2 of my students do not come to me via WyzAnt but are direct referrals by previous/current students, local schools and teachers, and former colleagues). When a lesson is cancelled later than that, I am not only unable to tutor the student who cancelled but also any one else whom would have gladly filled the time slot (yes, I love my work with each and every one of my students but my time is as valuable as yours and I expect (strong verb...I know!) for it to be respected and and of course I deserve to be compensated for my work. Phew! We are done with the uncomfortable stuff! I love everything science, math, literacy, and multicultural! In my spare time, I enjoy goofing out with my son and our science \"experiments\" (one time we were snowed in and had a ball building volcanoes and DNA models, on Halloween, we made elephant toothpaste and had our front step inundated by pumpkin puke!). I am willing to meet anywhere in Buckhead, Midtown, Fulton, Gwinnett, Dekalb, and Cobb County for the right assignments. I look forward to getting you excited about learning! Hang with me and you will have a good time!",

My job required that I interact with companies and individuals in Argentina, Colombia and Panama. On several occasions those business requirements also provided me the opportunity to  travel to those countries and meet with business people and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe practical knowledge of Spanish gained through my career experiences has allowed me to contribute to my community, mostly in the form volunteer work at my church where I perform translation tasks of literature that is to be published in both English and Spanish.  This led to private teaching and tutoring opportunities among members of the church and later to tutoring engagements throughout a larger community.\r\n\r\nI have now been tutoring Spanish at various levels for the past 4 years.  I currently teach students in middle school, high school, and university as well as several in the business world who seek to become conversant in Spanish for career related reasons.  The approach I take with each student depends on their current level of proficiency, their goals and their learning pace.  I addition to teaching native English speakers, I have recently started to work with students who were born into a Spanish speaking family but, having attending public schools in the U.S., have lost their ability to converse in Spanish and want to regain it for personal or family reasons.\r\n\r\nI truly love Spanish and am confident that I can bring to and to your learning experience the joy that I find in it every day.\r\n",

            "FreeResponse": "SERVICES AND POLICIES\n\nI am a Computer Engineering major at FIU. I specialize in teaching Mathematics. I also help with: essay writing, French, Haitian Creole, and academic Spanish. I have been tutoring since 2010.\n\nAreas where I can provide the best help are: Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, College Algebra, SAT-Math, ACT-Math, PERT prep math, EOC prep Algebra and Geometry, French (all levels), Spanish class at any level. \n\nI am very efficient at explaining notions and singling out problems that prevent a student from improving or moving forward. I explain things in a way that the student will understand and remember. I am committed to helping students understand notions for themselves. I tutor people of all ages, backgrounds, levels, schools, or programs. All a student needs with me is willingness to work hard, learn, get better, and cooperate. \n\nI provide supplemental help and training. For SAT and ACT for instance, I have extra materials and I give out custom exercises based on what is in the guides and practice tests. I have study guides for both tests. \n\nOnline help is available! I can teach over the internet. I can also help with online classes and assignments such as ALEKS, MyLabsPlus, FLVS Algebra 1, FLVS English, FLVS Algebra 2, FLVS Geometry, IXL, and others of the like. I have helped several students get very good grades in the past with online work. \n\nI can coach a student throughout a semester, school year or any duration the student or parent wishes for. I also know how to do a crash review or carry intensive preparation for a test, homework packet, or exam. Do not hesitate to contact me. Also I can make up my own program for specified review and improvement for a student.\n\nI am very committed as a tutor. I want to show the student that the fight is also my fight and that I will do whatever that is in my power to help. Since the student or parent is investing in his/her education, I feel honored and accountable to be chosen and I take my role to heart. I also want the student and parent to be working with me with freedom of mind, therefore if a client wants to discuss any details with me such as location, ease, methods and money, feel free to bring that up anytime. I am very reachable. \n\nThe parent or student does not have to be or feel committed to me. It does not always work out the way we want to. Therefore if someone wants to stop anytime, definitely or indefinitely, that is alright. Before starting to work with a new student I will hold conversations with the student or parent to know what to expect from each other.\n\nMy schedule is flexible. I prefer to have a set schedule; but if a student or parent prefers to have lessons on-demand, those should be requested and confirmed the day before. As for cancellations, they must happen at least three hours before the scheduled start time. I am very reachable. Once we are connected after following WyzAnt due process, you can call, text or WhatsApp any time. \n\nStudents I work with appreciate my enthusiasm, patience, professionalism, sense of commitment, and my encouragement and trust of them. Good connection and efficient cooperation lead my students to be more motivated to show effort, and be more eager to learn.\n\n\n\nBIOGRAPHY AND METHODS\n\nWhen I moved to the United States following the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, I was already in the 12th grade. I had only 4 months to fulfill all my requirements and earn my High School diploma, which I did. \n\nAfter graduating from North Miami Senior High, I attended St. Thomas University, where I was doing a Communication Arts program until I stopped. Following a hiatus, I am now in the Computer Engineering program at Florida International University.\n\nWhen I was in my native country Haiti, I was fortunate to attend some of the best schools, including Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague, where the rigorous teaching of Mathematics and languages was a big factor in making me what I am today.\n\nWhen I was in 10th grade particularly, I had an incredible teacher who taught me to seek to learn beyond the formula. I learned to put an emphasis on the understanding and application of notions, to not only instruct but educate. Since very few teachers take that conscious time to actually explain and break down formulas and concepts, I task myself to do it. This creates an atmosphere where the student stays engaged, and my tutoring does not feel as annoying as the classroom.\n\nNot only did I learn in school, I have also learned a whole lot from my students over the years. Therefore I encourage them to ask questions or share anything. With my experience I have come to know several methods and different types of exercises. As an educator, this has made me flexible and efficient. \n\nThis said, there must certainly be hard work involved on behalf of the student. For instance in math, formulas and operation tables must be studied, and for languages, vocabulary and conjugation rules must be known. In many cases, just the tutoring session is not enough for drastic improvement. For instance, if a Middle-School or High School math student really wants to take the next level, the notes I will give during the tutoring session must be reviewed at some indicated point, and the student has to practice math on a consistent basis, especially if the lessons are not frequent. \n\nI keep the parent or the student informed of the progress. I am also open to communicate with teachers. \n\nI always invite the student to aim for excellence. The higher you aim, the higher you get.",

After graduating, I worked at Broward College in South Florida tutoring Algebra, Calculus, Statistics, Chemistry, and Biology.  Soon after, I worked with a local company tutoring for the SAT and ACT.  I helped many students to increase their scores substantially, earn scholarship money, and get into the schools of their choice.  Eventually I returned to graduate school, but I continued to tutor math and chemistry.  Even though I now work as an engineer, I am still helping students to learn because I enjoy helping out and keeping my skills sharp.  I consider myself a lifelong learner. \n\nStudents like to work with me because I am encouraging, patient and easy to get along with. I can work well with most students from high school or college. One reason that makes me qualified is that I have an undergraduate degree in chemistry (minor in Spanish) and a graduate degree in chemical engineering, so I have a solid background in chemistry and math. In addition, I communicate very well so it is usually easy for students to learn from me.  \n\nIf you need help, feel free to ask a question to see if I can help!",

I obtained two bachelor's degrees- one in Spanish with a minor in Translation and the other in Community Health Sciences. I have been learning and using my Spanish daily from the time I was 12 years old! I work once a year at the Safari Club International convention as an interpreter and translator for an Argentinian hunting group. I also have experience interpreting for Spanish speaking patients during their medical procedures. \r\n\r\nI love to teach! I've tutored Spanish and Anthropology and received great feedback from my students. I have over 15 years of Spanish under my belt and have learned many tricks to the language along the way. Knowing another language has opened countless doors and hearts in my life. I am a firm believer that the more knowledge you have, the more powerful you are because it's something no one can take away from you.  \r\n\r\nI think what sets me apart from other Spanish speakers that have Spanish as their second language is my fluency. Being able to read and write Spanish is great, but speaking it well is an art form. I incorporate music into my study, because it trains the ear and not the eye. \r\n\r\nLearning Spanish and German has undoubtedly made me a better English speaker. My advanced linguistic courses in college taught me about how the mouth forms sounds, and how those sounds compare across languages. I have a knack for the written word, and truly enjoy helping people communicate better using the best of their language. \r\n\r\nI encourage you, as students, to continue mastering your language skills. I promise you it will serve you well if you put the time in to be great at it- which is true with anything in life. Strive to be excellent, and contact me if you'd like help in your journey! ",

The formulas and equations my teacher was writing on the board might as well have been another language. My mother hired a tutor to help assist me. I remember his smiling face, friendly demeanor, and, most importantly, his desire to see me succeed. Thanks to his care, I found success in the mathematics world and went on to win the Algebra 2 award as a high school student. I remember the amazing feeling of success I had when I overcame my struggles in math. I have a strong desire to help others achieve this same feeling as well!\n\nI completed a full year of mathematics education at Purdue University before deciding to switch to Agricultural Economics, so I would be able to find a career on my family's farm. I have experience teaching as a substitute for my local school corporation and also taught a computer class this past spring to help cover for a teacher on maternity leave. While subbing, I was given the opportunity to teach lesson plans in Algebra 1 and 2 left behind by the regular teacher. I would help any students struggling and answer their questions. \n\nAnother subject in which I am both passionate and knowledgeable is Spanish. I have a minor in Spanish from Purdue University where I studied abroad in Spain. Whether you're a high school student needing help in a course, an adult wanting to learn a new language, or trying to prepare for a trip to a Spanish-speaking country, I'm the tutor for you! I use our session time to teach you exactly what you need. I provide you with resources that you can use on the days that you don't have a session scheduled so you can keep learning even without me.  \n\nI have experience teaching and tutoring homeschool students in algebra, pre-algebra, pre-calculus, and Spanish levels 1, 2, and 3. \n\nAs a tutor, I understand that questions may arise throughout the week on days when we do not have sessions scheduled. That's why, in addition to the tutoring I offer my students, I also offer free homework help. If you or your child find they are struggling on a homework assignment and need assistance from me ASAP, all you need to do is call me up! As long as the session does not go over 15 minutes, you will not be charged. \n\nI have a passion for education that I would love to pass on to your children!

Aside from that, I have organised multiple informal study sessions for classmates who struggled with a particular subject both during my Undergraduate and my Master's degrees.\n\nI'm a Spanish native speaker from Spain, with previous experience in tutoring Spanish grammar at High School level. Further, I have an outstanding record as a Spanish student (both language and literature), including the Spanish university access exams. Most importantly, I love studying/teaching Spanish and new languages in general.\n\nGiven my academic and personal background, I am very experienced in public speaking in diverse scenarios, from academic conferences to scientific posters, project presentations, among others. Additionally, I have led presentation panels, conducted focus groups, led interviews, managed meetings and even participated in theatre plays, so I am used to work with multiple audiences besides students/teachers. I have also participated in multiple courses that covered public speaking directly, both from the leadership and assertiveness perspectives and my background has provided me with additional insights on effective public speaking/message communication in less direct ways.\n\nMy study skills are have been highly developed during my entire studies, which allowed me to become Top Performing Student in all my courses, going as far back as Secondary School. Furthermore, I have received specific study skills and techniques training and coaching from a very young age, so I am familiar with techniques that can benefit different specific intelligence types besides my own. \n\nDuring my course of studies, I graduated from High School specialising in Humanities, completed my undergraduate in Political Science and Public Administration and graduated from a MSc in Political Psychology. Therefore, during all these years I completed many courses of study about government and politics (from political theory to politics and communication, public sector administration and economics, electoral systems, collective action, international relations or politics and globalisation, among many others) and History (Spanish and Catalan history, European contemporary History, History of the XX century, international History, History of economics, and many other more general courses that covered from Prehistory to the present time).\n\nAll in all, I love learning and sharing my knowledge with others. Seeing my students progress makes me genuinely happy and proud, and it's one of the main reasons why I want to keep tutoring. I know that not everyone is so excited about studies as I am, and that's okay too, although I secretly hope that by helping you out I can make you love the subject too (or hate less, at least?). I look forward to working with you!",

            "FreeResponse": "Bienvenido/a a mi perfil. Me llamo Christelle y soy profesora. ¡Encantada!\n\nI was born in Argentina and spent the first half of my life there and then moved to Spain, where I lived until 2016 when I moved to Chicago area.\n\nWhile I was still getting my Bachelor's Degree in English Philology in Barcelona, I started working in language schools teaching English to all ages.\nI worked as an EFL (English as a Foreign Language) teacher for almost 7 years. I have experience with children as young as 1 y/o, one-to-one lessons, small and large groups.\n\nI am currently working as a Spanish and Art teacher in a private school in Oak Brook, Fusion Academy. I work with high schoolers who struggle learning in conventional learning environments.\nI also have a Spanish Teacher certification from International House Barcelona and I am an official DELE (Diploma of Spanish as a Foreign Language) examiner certified by Instituto Cervantes.\n\nABOUT MY PRIVATE LESSONS\n\nI can help you improve your current level of Spanish, help your children with Spanish at school, or teach you Spanish from scratch! \n\n LOCATIONS\nI live in Bloomingdale and work in the DuPage county area. I meet most of my students in local coffee shops like Starbucks or Panera, but at-home lessons are possible as well.\n\n FEES\nI charge $35 per hour per person, but fees are negotiable, especially if we meet more than once a week or in groups. I will take location into account.\n\n LESSON FREQUENCY AND LENGTH\n\nIt would depend on your goals. School tutoring usually requires less time because Spanish at school is extremely basic and it’s doesn’t really lead to fluency in the language. Anything else needs a greater degree of commitment! I meet my students for one hour once or twice per week AT LEAST. \n\n TEACHING METHOD\nFor school tutoring I try to adapt to your school’s method. For other types of lessons, I prefer avoiding translation and memorization and make use of effective Spanish textbooks, technology, games and free conversation.\n\n SCHEDULE / AVAILABILITY\nI mostly teach Monday-Friday afternoons and weekends in the morning.\n\n RESCHEDULING / CANCELLATIONS / PUNCTUALITY\nI understand flexibility is convenient and appreciated, so I allow rescheduling and cancellations in case of emergency or with enough advance notice. I recommend students to stick to their agreed schedule if they want to achieve their goals, even if that means to meet at another time during that same week. If I am already on my way to your lesson and you need to cancel, I will charge for the lesson. If you’re going to be late, please let me know, and I can’t guarantee that I can stay later than our scheduled time.\n\n FIRST LESSON\nDuring our first lesson we will take time to go over any important information, set our goals and answer questions regarding nature of our lessons. We can talk about fees and teaching materials during this lesson as well.\n\n\nFor any more details or any questions, please don’t hesitate contacting me!",

I have taught both Spanish and Math in Houston for the past few years and have experience as a certified teacher and tutor. I am passionate about educating and helping students meet and exceed their academic goals.\r\n\r\nI am a very empathetic and outgoing person, traits that make me a great tutor. My approach to teaching a new lesson is through experience, coming up with a new way for students to master material that will stay with them much longer than a session. I have extensive content knowledge and experience writing and adapting lessons to fit the needs of my students. In the past few years I have tutored both individually and in small groups. I like to target my sessions to specific objectives, so that both the student and I can measure their growth and needs as a learner. My educational philosophy is that everyone learns differently and deserves a tailored approach to meet their style. This is the same attitude I bring to tutoring.\r\n\r\nI taught 7th grade math for a year at YES Prep Hoffman. \r\n\r\nI have a minor in anthropology and took AP biology in high schools and botany in college. \r\n\r\nI have a degree in Spanish as well as multiple years of Spanish teaching experience. I taught different levels of Spanish as well. I have my teaching certification in LOTE-Spanish. \r\n\r\nI took AP English classes in high school. I was a journalism major for two years in college and took multiple classes on writing and editing. \r\n\r\nTutoring is a partnership and I encourage students and parents to provide any feedback or resources they think will help them grow as a learner. I am highly organized and respond quickly. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or to schedule a session! \r\n\r\nI am a very easy going and dedicated tutor. I have a lot of experience and am committed to growing you as a student. Message me so we can get started with our first session! ",

Speaking a second language gives you a chance to find more friends in the world. For business you can earn 10-25% more than your coworkers and more likely to earn promotions.

I have a BFA in Studio Art with minors in Art & Visual Culture Education and Spanish, as well as a Yoga Teacher Certification, CELTA and ten years of teaching experience. I love to experience new cultures, learn languages, make art and share my knowledge. \n\nMy wanderlust has led me to travel extensively and live abroad. I studied language in Paris and Oaxaca and volunteered in India teaching youth and adults about HIV/AIDS. After graduation from U of A, while living in Mexico city I was an Artist in Residence with Oficina de Arte, an ESL teacher and tutor for business people and I studied Flamenco dance. \n\nThis is my fourth year of teaching Visual Art and ESL at a small charter school in Tucson. I love teaching to small groups and working with students individually because they are able to analyze, synthesize and evaluate new information and techniques quickly and effectively. I encourage all of my students to be creative and open themselves to experimentation so they can find their authentic selves and let it shine through in their work.\n\nI'm a native English speaker who is CELTA certified and I have experience teaching international students of all ages and levels. What makes me a strong tutor in ESL is that I have successfully learned a foreign language myself, thus I can provide empirical knowledge and practical tips for self-directed learning, in addition to selecting appropriate practice material for students.\n\nI have a minor in Spanish and I lived in Latin America for about 3 years. I feel confident in tutoring Spanish as a result of the time and effort I have put into studying the language myself. I can share anecdotes and strategies that have helped me remember new vocabulary and learn grammar structures. Hopefully we will link student interests to aspects of Spanish/Latin American culture in a meaningful way that helps the student foster an invested and individual relationship with the language.\n\nI have been drawing all my of life. I excelled in the Arts throughout grade school and continued to study Art at the undergraduate level.  In addition to taking many hundreds of hours of figure drawing, painting, printmaking, wood/metal working and photography classes, I spend large amounts of my free time practicing my craft. \n\nI feel fulfilled when I share my passion with others. I've taught people of all ages and all experience levels. I believe a good teacher perceives their students as individuals and approaches them at their own level with a plan to accomplish nuanced educational goals. I look forward to working with you!",

I have taught and supervised children in church settings for 12 years plus; I helped supervise those younger than me in church youth group; in high school I practiced as a teacher's aide; I have tutored a middle school age boy; and most recently I have taken a love for instructing swim lessons. I like tutoring because I can make a difference in someone's life by helping them and also empowering them.\n\nThe approach I take to tutoring/instructing a student is all about what that student needs. Whether they need courage to stick their face under water, the preterit tense of \"saber\", or to know how to kick a ball low, I teach them how and why they need these skills. If a student does not know these key answers, they are not really learning. For me school has mostly come natural, but I had a much easier time learning when I grasped how and why I need to learn a topic/skill.\n\nPlease consider me as a tutor/instructor.",

            "FreeResponse": "I love to learn and many years ago I realized that teaching is a good way to be used to learn. I studied, in two universities simultaneously, two different programs (Education Technology and Physical Therapy).  Some people may not see the connection, but in my Physical Therapy practice I have seen this connection with education more than with other subject.  I have been able to practice what I learned from the education field to help my patients gain their health.  In the rehabilitation field, I know how important is to understand how our patients learn.  This will allow us to prevent further injuries, for example. I have great passion for both fields of study.  I think that I teach with the same passion I use when I am instructing my patients to care for their health, when I write an article about health prevention, as when I am doing my research work, as much as when I am helping someone that want to learn Spanish.  I have the experience teaching in various settings that goes from formal to informal teaching, online or in a class conference in the field of health. I love to help others, and not long ago I found that teaching a language is fun.   Perhaps, this is the reason I found easy learning my fourth language- (English).\n\nNow, I am offering to teach Spanish, on one hand because I enjoy helping others and with this, I want to believe, I help to brake a barrier that separates people in the world. Furthermore, learning a language helps our brain and it is fun to share this experience with a dedicated and committed student. It is also important start learning a language taught by a native speaker. I am original from Venezuela, and my knowledge not only is limited to science.  I like to learn from people that are in different fields of study. Many are my skills, but I consider my patience, perseverance, and creativity are my best skills. In general, I believe that learning must be fun and when learning a language it is better yet if we use real life examples. After all, we are learning a second language to communicate better with people of the other language.",

I love helping students learn and improve in languages and I am very patient when it comes to tutoring. I like to have fun in the process, too.

I enjoy teaching one-to-one because it allows me to tailor the classes to each student’s individual needs, passions, and goals. I'm really interested in keeping you enthusiastic about your English studies by providing challenging and experiential classes. I make the most of what the internet and my other colleagues have to offer by incorporating CNN, YouTube and other online tools.\n\nMy experience includes teaching all aspects of English (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) and I've specialized much of my teaching to include ESP (English for specific purposes) such as medical, legal, environmental, cultural education, academics, and business communication.\n\nI am an avid reader. I hold a Master's in Psych and am pursuing a second Master's in TESOL and Linguistics. My interests include psychology, history, travel, anything to do with animals, and international cooking.

My literary translation from Spanish has been published in The Sewanee Review of Literature and other magazines. I earned my BA at Yale University and I'm in my thesis year for my MFA  in Creative Writing at the University of the South.\n\nSpanish Tutor: I wrote my own book on beginning Spanish grammar for medical students at Einstein College of Medicine, and for many years I was a Spanish language curriculum developer at Manhattan's Latin American Workshop language school.  I use a communicative approach and prepare personalized online study tools for my students, including \"talking\" flash cards, animated power points, and exercises tailored to the student's needs and curriculum. I work with high school through adult students.\n\nWriting, Grammar, Language Arts: I teach grammar, punctuation, and writing and reading comprehension skills to students 15 to adult. I was a marketing writer for Sports Illustrated, Time International, and wrote editorial copy for The Westchester Wedding Planner and Interview magazine.  Academic writing, especially in the area of English literature, is a specialty (APA and Chicago styles). I help my students learn to conceptualize and plan their writing projects, understand essay and story structure, and develop their creative instincts and curiosity. In addition to my work with students, I have edited books for Fortune 500 executives, and coach businesspeople who want to learn how to write more effective memos, reports and presentations.\n\nWhatever subject I'm teaching, I'm sensitive to different learning styles and adapt my approach to the individual student. \n\nI prefer to schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings at a regular hour and for a minimum of four meetings scheduled in advance, except for the  first lesson which is our chance to see if we are a good match as tutor and student. All classes are online, and require a (free) fifteen minute set up meeting to make sure our technology is working. For online classes, you need a private room where you won't be interrupted, a fast internet connection, and headphones (preferably with built-in mic).\nLet's talk. I look forward to meeting you!",

I love teaching through games, discussion, and I am flexible to help  you how you want and need!\r\n\r\nI have been speaking Spanish for nine years now! I have only received A's and B's in my Spanish classes. In high school I took the AP Spanish exam and the Spanish SAT. It is my major at college and I took my capstone as a first semester Sophomore with other seniors. I studied in Madrid, Spain in Fall 2016 and am finishing my degree this Spring. I am exceptional in speaking, listening, writing, and helping others with finding their passion for Spanish.\r\n\r\nI have always loved the English language. In addition to being in school, I am a writer. I have been published in Cordella Magazine, Recenter Press, and Visual Verse. I also released a book in 2017. I had a blogging job when I was abroad and have written academically and creatively in my work before.\r\n\r\nArt history is one of my favorite subjects! As my minor in university, I think it is one of the most interesting subjects. I have done graduate research in art history during summers 2016 and 2017.

I have worked as a private tutor for the past 7 years and graduated from the University of Central Florida with my BS in Mathematics last year.

My teaching philosophy is simple - to truly impact the lives of my students while supporting their academic success! I not only love my subject area, but each and every one of my students as well.\n\nWhy choose me as a tutor?\n\n- Math is not the only subject I tutor! In my undergraduate courses, I excelled in English Composition, Speech and Humanities courses and I have tutored the mentioned subjects for nearly 4 years. Generally, my tutoring involves assistance with essays, grammar, proofreading and general understanding of literary concepts.\n\n- I have experience working diverse environments which allowed me to begin working with hard of hearing and deaf students. Over the course of 7 years, I have established close relationships with several hard of hearing/deaf students that I have helped succeed in a variety of courses. It has become a strong passion of mine to provide this type of unique tutoring service.\n \n- While ultimately I adjust my tutoring style to each individual student, I have a detailed and thorough method of tutoring. With math in particular, organization is essential and I try to implement overall good study habits and note taking skills.\n\n*I have a flexible availability and try my best to accommodate any schedule.

            "FreeResponse": "Greetings! I have a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from The College of Wooster, a Masters in Chemistry, and a PhD in Environmental Science, both from George Mason University. My professional endeavors have included being a Chemist at the American Dental Association Paffenbarger Research Center, a pre-doctoral fellow at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, a Scientific Liaison at the US Geological Survey, and a consultant for the Energy and Environment team for LMI. In 2007 I became a stay at home Mom who also works part-time as a consultant and as a tutor.\n\nI have both taught and tutored chemistry at the college and graduate level, tutored elementary and high-school students in math and chemistry, tutored elementary school to college students in Spanish, and have taught study skills to student athletes (I was a student athlete myself and know firsthand the need to balance academics with sports: a tutor can help you thrive).\n\nI am very patient and thorough and particularly enjoy working one-on-one with students of all ages. My tutoring style is to work with each student at their level, identifying and addressing each obstacle preventing them from understanding and mastering the topic. In addition I am bilingual in Spanish and so I can help bridge any language barriers (should those exist) that are preventing the student from thriving academically.\n\nMy method is to create an environment that fosters mutual respect while making learning fun yet thorough, using what I call the four “Cs” of learning: clear, concrete, concise and complete. For example, if while tutoring chemistry I encounter that the student is lacking in math, I make sure to review the math necessary to understand and do well in chemistry.  \n\nIn my experience, a tutor can help you thrive. As each student begins to understand and master the topic, he/she will feel more confident and able to take on challenges in the academic (like exams in the subject matter or taking higher level courses) as well as in life.   \n\nThank you for reading my tutoring profile. I hope that I can help you or your loved one(s) thrive in the academic world!\n\nNOTE: My hourly rate for tutoring groups or more advanced subjects like Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry is $65 as each tutoring session takes preparation on my part.",

            "FreeResponse": "I have been tutoring students in math for around 25 years. I have tutored students in various branches of math ranging from arithmetic to calculus. I have tutored students as young as my nephews as well as students older than my mother. My methods in mathematics have been proven to work well. Many of my past clients have passed Regents exams, RCTs, did well on standardized tests like SATs and ACTs, and earned excellent grades in college and graduate level courses. Recently, most of my clients have been teachers. Many of them have struggled with a math course at some point, and my tutoring assistance helped them greatly towards earning their Master's Degree. I have shown proficiency in math since my youth. My father taught me basic algebra as a 7-year-old. I became proficient in geometry as an 8-year-old, and this knowledge still sticks with me to this day. I would love to pass on some of this knowledge to some of prospective students. I look forward to working with you prospective students in the future.\n My educational experience is as follows. I attended high school at A. Philip Randolph Campus High School in New York. I graduated with a Regents Diploma in 1996. I attended Cornell University from 1996-2000, and received a B.S. in Engineering. I am currently working on my Master's Degree at Empire State College in New York City. Throughout my education, I have excelled more so in mathematics than any other subject. I scored 90+ on all of my Regents math exams including a perfect score on second year sequential math. I also scored a 5 on the nationwide AP test for Calculus AB. In college I received A's in my linear algebra classes and in my two calculus classes. During those times, I have helped numerous students master the subject like I did. \n  Now with 20+ years of tutoring  under my belt, I believe that I can give adequate assistance to a new crop of students who may be experiencing difficulty in certain areas of math. I am more than qualified to assist such students, and it is a pleasure of mine that will probably never die. Let's tackle these math problems together. With my assistance, you'll become very proficient in your area of math.",

I just completed my BCLAD (language learning theories) certification from Stanford University.  I do offer a free, one 15 min. lesson to see if my style is a good fit for you. After years of tutoring Spanish, French, and English, I'm happy to have 100% returning Spanish, French, Conversational English, Italian, and English writing students, as well as receive positive feedback from each student. In the accompanying picture, I am translating Spanish for President Clinton for the Red Cross; it was an honor to translate for him as I love languages and helping people, especially for the Red Cross Disaster Relief services.  \n\nI tutor Spanish, French, English, SAT English, SAT Writing, CBEST prep, writing strategies, as well as computer applications such as Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Publisher, Outlook, iPhoto, iMovie, Keynote, Pages (for Mac), various iPad apps, all in Spanish or English.\n\nMy style is RELAXED and very positive, as I teach a language it's even FUN whether it be a computer application or a language lesson, including writing.  I think feeling comfortable is most important when trying to understand a new language.  I also bring various techniques that include technology, short grammar videos, games, short culture videos, songs that the student likes, and texts from topics that the given student likes. I really customize each training session to get my student up to speed and able to understand the given concepts, no matter if it is English 1, 2, English 101, Spanish 1, Spanish 5, French 2 or Italian 1.  \n\nI lived in Spain in college and visited in high school.  I've traveled to Mexico, Aruba, and El Caribe.  I have been proud of my 100% retention of all students whom I have tutored because I am helpful, easy going, and effective.  I customize each class to fit their individual needs, and I do not charge for prep time. Currently I teach teachers at a tech school. I have taught Spanish at the high school, college, and middle school levels (Spanish I, Spanish II, Spanish III, Spanish IV, Spanish V, AP Spanish, Spanish 101, Spanish 102, Spanish 201 and Spanish 202). And I've also taught English and French 1 and visited a great French family in Lyon, outside Paris for 3 wonderful months.  Last summer, I went to Italy and loved that travel experience, too, because I was able to apply my Italian courses from way back in college each day. (I translated for friends for the last 4 weeks, which helped my overall comprehension, grammar rules, and fluency in Italian, my fourth language.)\n\nI am looking forward to taking the fear out of learning a language for you one day soon, and I currently teach technology to teachers, English as a second language, and Spanish at a public school.  I've taught Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Inspiration, and Publisher with simple and easy-to-understand handouts for more than 6 years.\n\nPlease note my many and numerous , 99% 5-star ratings and recommendations for my English, Spanish, French and computer applications students from 2010 until present.   I look forward to working with you one day soon.  If you may have any questions, just let me know. I use files on my iPad or laptop to show concepts in an interesting and fun way, as well as provide relevance to whatever the concepts that we are learning each session.\n\nAt the present time, I prefer to tutor within 20 miles of Fountain Valley, if this may work for you. \nThe first 15 minutes are free to see if my methods work well for you. I understand that people learn differently and thus prefer specific teaching styles.  Mine is hands on, relaxed with lots and lots of examples. And I always ask at least once during the lesson how is my pace, so that I am not going too fast, nor too slow.\n\nClasses on Saturday mornings are fine esp. if it is exam time.  Questions?  Just let me know.  I will respond to your email within a few hours, except on Memorial Day, the second week of June, July 4th, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, and New Year's Day.",

I would be delighted to have the opportunity to help you!\r\n\r\nMy name is Keshia, and I absolutely love languages. As a current ESL teacher and Spanish tutor, I am prepared to help you meet your language learning goals. I am a very patient and friendly person, who knows not only what it takes to learn a new language but also how to be the right person to help someone else learn a language. I have the experience of being a language student myself as a student in a Spanish school in Mexico where I learned to speak Spanish fluently. I also have experience as a language teacher. I began teaching English in Mexico and then have continued to do so in the United States. Over the past five years as a language teacher, I have developed my own style of teaching. My teaching approach is direct, focusing mainly on speaking and listening well. I focus on making my lessons fun and personalized. I look forward to assessing your current Spanish or English level and then helping you reach your language learning goals.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to working with young people, I have prior experience tutoring elementary school and high school students in various subjects including Spanish. I also had the opportunity to work with middle school students directly in a girl's group that I started and led for 4 years. More recently, I privately tutored 3 elementary school students (2 brothers and 1 sister) in Spanish. I enjoy helping young people discover a passion of learning a new language.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to working with adults, I worked students ages 19-32 in an English class that I managed and taught at a mission's base in Oaxaca, Mexico. Currently, I teach two adult English classes throughout the week. The occupations of my students have ranged anywhere from stay-at-home moms to business professionals. I am known for my patience and genuine kindness with my students while also challenging and encouraging them to meet their language goals. \r\n\r\nI would love to help you in your language journey. Feel free to contact me, and I will get back to you within 24 hours. I am a people person and am easy to talk to and work with, so I think that I would be a right fit for you. Thank-you!",

I have been a tutor since 2003 (over twelve years and thousands of hours of experience) working with families of students ranging between preschool to adult in age. I have helped dozens of students in the following subject areas: math, reading, writing, grammar, spelling, science, history, study skills, Spanish, prealgebra, and algebra to name a few. I have a teaching degree from Oakland University and I taught middle school science for three years before becoming a professional tutor. I do speak Spanish (limited - and studied it for six years.)  \n\nNot only do I teach at night, but I homeschool my own children during the day. I am patient, kind, and committed to the students and families I work with in improving their educational skills. I believe every child/adult has the ability to learn. With patient and caring instruction, a desire from the student to want to improve, and support from their family, he/she can accomplish their academic goals.  I believe in the tutoring experience, that sometimes, all it takes is to have a tutor work with the student and fit the missing pieces of understanding back into place. I have had much success over the years and I look forward to being the jigsaw piece that helps complete your student's academic portrait!\n\nLeadership:\n\nThere is a growing need to teach students leadership skills. Everyone is called to lead in some capacity as he/she matures and learns through life's lessons. Having the right information can lead the way toward opportunity and success in every aspect of a student's life. Blending a solid academic foundation with the life skills supported by leadership principles, will give your student the posture, confidence, and preparedness to enter life's journey after high school. It is never too early to begin teaching life changing principles. Give your student the extra edge and inquire of ways leadership skills can be added to your student's academic experience.",

            "FreeResponse": "Are you looking for someone to help with any of your Math struggles? I'm your guy! My name is Jeremy and I'm currently a full-time math tutor! At the University of Florida, I was a Math major with a minor in education.  I took courses all the way through Calculus 1, 2, and 3 as well as Differential Equations. \n\nI changed my major to Business Administration when I changed my career path to work in management at Publix Supermarkets. As great of a company as they are, I made the decision earlier this year to get out of retail to pursue my passion of teaching and tutoring math. I'm comfortable with various levels of math. My mom was a math teacher so I grew up loving math. I'm excited to help out any students in need. In April, I started volunteering at one of the local middle schools in Gainesville to get back into the actual classroom setting. Sometimes I help teach a lesson with the teacher and other times I work with students one-on-one that are having a hard time understanding the material. This was the same time I also started to tutor students using Wyzant and I have been privileged to work some great students ranging from middle school to the college level.  Some of the different levels of math that I’m very comfortable with tutoring is Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Trigonometry, and Pre-Calculus. \n\nMost of my experiences is with working with Middle School students, High School students, and College students. I try to make math fun and understandable by getting creative such as using white boards. Like I said before, I stopped working full-time so my schedule is flexible to work with students. I'm very patient with the people I tutor. Feel free to contact with any questions!",

What immediately distinguishes me from other tutors is my extensive background in the learning process, and how it can be targeted for improved performance across all subject domains. There are no natural-born geniuses; students who are able to better comprehend, retain, and execute what they've learned with fewer resources, time, and effort merely have acquired these skills earlier in life; I work closely with students to ensure they master these skills, so that whatever they learn they will learn for a lifetime. If learning has ever felt like a chore or a hassle, then look no further! I make learning feel tangible and relevant.\n\n= My Tutoring Philosophy =\nLearning is a skill, and, like any skill, it can be refined and improved with proper instruction and guidance.\n\n= My Guarantee =\nI will NOT CHARGE you if you are not completely satisfied with my performance. I am WILLING TO NEGOTIATE PRICING based on financial ability, tutoring format, session length & frequency, group tutoring, and other factors. I will provide FREE SUPPORT IN-BETWEEN SESSIONS via email and Skype instant messages.\n\n= My Tutoring Experience =\nI have worked closely with students of all ages and abilities over the past several years. Most of my high school and college students who earned a 'C' their first semester ended up earning an 'A' in their second semester and subsequent courses with only two hours of tutoring a week. While volunteering at St. Mary's Children's Hospital, I have worked closely with elementary and middle school students to keep pace with schoolwork while they were confined to the hospital for long-term care. I have experience working with student peers who experience difficulties with esteem, motivation, and/or concentration to make complete and total attitude and behavioral changes. These problems, which are said to occur in the Self-System and/or the Metacognitive System of the Human Psyche, can be targeted and corrected just like any other behavior. \n\n= My Background =\nI am a multidisciplinary individual, with a background in computing and education.\n \nI earned my BS in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. While a student, I  served as a teaching assistant and academic tutor, and became a published researcher in the math-savvy field of Computer Vision. Over the past several years, I have worn many hats in the computing industry, where I have worked as a software engineer, a web designer & developer, a triple-certified IT technician, a technical writer & editor, a public speaker, a business consultant, and a technological entrepreneur.\n\nI also have a background in the learning process and knowledge acquisition, where I've spent several years conducting research, innovating new learning methodologies, and developing educational software. I am fluent in The New Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, which is a modern revision of Bloom's Taxonomy. I use the New Taxonomy heavily when designing custom syllabi for my students.",

            "FreeResponse": "I've been interested in learning foreign languages for as long as I can remember. I am very fortunate to have a full time job as a linguist/translator. Nothing fills me with more excitement than to share my love of languages with other eager people. \r\n\r\nLearning a foreign language has its challenges for sure; but there is something very rewarding about being able to fully immerse yourself in a culture and truly understand foreign perspectives through language. I'm easy going and very patient. I am willing to help you through all of the joys and struggles that come with learning a language.\r\n\r\nI am a huge astronomy and science nerd! The wonders of our universe are almost beyond belief, and I spend the majority of my leisure time reading and learning about our mysterious cosmos. I have taken several upper level college courses on the subject, but have gained most of my knowledge by reading textbooks and non-fiction books written by my favorite physicists. \r\n\r\nMy favorite scientist/astronomer of all time is Carl Sagan. Dr. Sagan promoted science literacy in all that he did and made it his life mission to communicate the sometimes complex subjects of astronomy and astrophysics to the average Joe. I hope that I might emulate him in my goal to teach the subject of astronomy and more importantly instill interest and inspire awe in my pupils.\r\n\r\nAs a linguist for the United States Navy, I have spent my career perfecting my language abilities! I have supported my fellow sailors and servicemen using my language abilities in order to ensure their safety. I am able to use Spanish and Portuguese fluently in speaking, reading, and writing. Learning these languages at the premier language school on the planet, the exclusive Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, was a real challenge. However, the manner in which DLI teaches languages through interactive immersion has allowed me to become an effective and direct language tutor.\r\n\r\nAs a career linguist, it is impossible to learn a foreign language without fully understanding your own mother tongue. To improve your language abilities it is imperative that you first establish a solid foundation on which to build. English is perhaps not as suave as some romance languages, but has precise and smooth flow that allows speakers to be extremely accurate with the thoughts that they are trying to articulate. I have also written several undergraduate level essays and reports in my current major of biochemistry. I feel that my ability to use the English language both in a casual manor and in an extremely technical and detail oriented manor gives me a unique ability as an English tutor.\r\n\r\nIf you're willing to put in the effort then I will always be eager to go the extra mile! Nothing makes me happier than when a student realizes that they can produce a foreign language for the first time. I believe that my willingness to make progress and my immeasurable passion for languages will have you eager to jump right in to conversation. I must warn you that my sessions are designed to make real progress through language immersion. So if you are ready to finally learn a foreign language, please contact me to set up our first session. I can't wait to be your tutor!",

Over the years I have \"unofficially\" taught Spanish to my oldest and he has impressed his educators in Elementary School each year when he would show off his skills. I do find it particularly important to introduce young children to foreign language as they soak up so much more information than we want to admit as adults! I am open to long-term and short-term tutoring needs. I honestly consider it an honor to tutor Spanish. I remember those who tutored me in math and while I felt I was a lost cause - the tutors in fact did not and that had a lasting impression on me.\n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to review my profile up to this point. I know that an ideal tutor is someone with more extensive experience, but all I can hope to receive is someone to give me a shot. I am a very flexible individual.

In teaching a foreign language I like to encourage students to use what they already know and are interested in to find out more about the world and make new friends, especially at a young age, but it works at any age.  I pay attention to grammar details as well as make classes fun for each individual, something tutoring lets you take advantage of as opposed to a bigger class in regular school.  I like to learn other languages, such as French and Chinese, to always remember what it is like to learn a language and therefore be a better teacher. Remembering what it is like to be a student in ANYTHING is important. I enjoy math, algebra, computer programs and general organizational skills that help prepare students to succeed. \n\nI am also a rowing coach, US Rowing certified, and a rower since 1997.

I am able to see the minds of my students at work, and have the ability to meet and match their language acquisition needs. As a fun-loving, extrovert who thrives on diversity and challenge, I fill tutoring sessions with fun, energy and opportunities to build language skills through success and positive feedback.\n\nI've studied German and French, but am only proficient in Spanish, so I understand that learning a second or foreign language can be difficult. I have lived in a foreign country, and as a result have a deep compassion for what it takes to acclimate to expat living. I also have been fortunate to receive a world-class education; my high school, undergraduate and graduate schools were all very rigorous and I always excelled in reading, writing, and all things related to communications. So, between my natural abilities, my education and my real-world experience - I am an ideal candidate help my students excel.\n\nI started studying Spanish formally in Junior High and continued with great success through High School. I passed the Spanish AP Test and enrolled in the Center for Foreign Studies at the University of Guadalajara, México, where I studied Language, History, and Culture for an academic year. By the time I left Mexico to attend U.C. Berkeley, I was conversationally bilingual.\n\nIn 2016, I attended the International Teacher Training Organization in Guadalajara, México to obtain my TESOL Certification. I stayed in México for 5 additional months to practice my teaching skills in a native Spanish speaking setting, as well as to sharpen my own Spanish language skills.\n\nI am a warm, friendly and encouraging teacher who will makes students feel comfortable at every level of instruction. I am available as early as 10am and as late at 8pm. I am happy to come to you, or to meet by video call. I look forward to hearing what would make your Spanish learning experience rewarding and meaningful!",

I wrote a book about the complicated world of private security contractors who work in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I now work helping these companies change their policies to meet new requirements for human rights' policies.  Although I sometimes travel overseas for my work, I am still committed to helping local Vermonters with their diverse educational goals.  Tutoring is a great way to do this.  \n\nI love studying languages, but Spanish is the one I know the best.  I have studied it for many years, and can speak easily.  I also love reading and translating, and learning idioms.  I am a type of person who studies languages as a 'hobby,' and I am currently learning Iraqi Arabic, and Turkish!  I also participate in local conversational groups in Spanish and French.  \n\nBefore I went to graduate school, I was an 8th grade English teacher at the University of Chicago Lab Schools, in Chicago.  Throughout graduate school, and subsequently as a professor here in Vermont, I spent much of my time reading and editing the writings of students, fellow graduate students, and  other academics.  I still do work as a freelance editor.    \n\nI have a PhD in Political Science, and love anything and everything connected with understanding our social and political world.  \n\nPlease get in touch to meet and discuss your particular needs.

I have taken a wide variety of classes, and thoroughly enjoy teaching biology.\r\n\r\nI am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Public Health. Biochemistry was one of my favorite classes in college. I have tutored a few college students in biochemistry, and am currently tutoring a student in bioinformatics. Many high school chemistry classes incorporate biochemistry into the curriculum.\r\n\r\nI love to travel, and a large portion of my tutoring experience has been abroad. I lived in Madrid, Spain for about a year; and I spent a lot of that time studying and tutoring English and Math. \r\n\r\nI have been a tutor for over 5 years now and I love to see my students get excited about learning. I tutor a wide range of subjects, and have experience tutoring for standardized exams such as the SAT and ACT. \r\n\r\nI have experiences with the following courses: Math- ACT Math, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Pre- algebra, Geometry, Pre-calculus\r\nEnglish- English as a second language, literature, SAT writing, and ACT/SAT reading comprehension. \r\n\r\nI also have experience with Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics, Developmental biology, anatomy, etc.\r\n",

            "FreeResponse": "Currently writing my PhD thesis in Philosophy, I've tutored and taught languages and mathematics before at High Schools in Sweden, where I was born. My pedagogical approach to teaching languages is that they must be learned both as systems (e.g. verb conjugations, morphology), and activity (e.g. speaking, reading). I have developed a method to do both of these and also combine them, which has been quite successful. This method means that not only do the students generally pass their tests with flying colors, but they actually learn to express themselves in the language. \r\n\r\nThis is something very particular about learning a language that is very different from learning other things: namely that at a certain point, you will be able to express yourself verbally in this new way. The grammar--an abstract system--becomes intuitive. This is a beautiful thing to experience, and a beautiful thing for a teacher to see. \r\n\r\nI have translated professionally from French and German into Swedish and English, and I've taught these languages as well as Spanish and Latin at High Schools in Stockholm, Sweden. In my PhD research, I work on language from a philosophical viewpoint (working primarily with the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the Linguist Ferdinand de Saussure). I've also worked as a copy writer in English as well as Swedish.\r\n\r\nWhen I applied to PhD programs I scored top percentile on my TOEFL (i.e. the highest possible score). I also scored 92 percentile on the verbal GRE (meaning that I scored higher than 92% of the others who took the test, most of whom are native English speakers). My method for teaching languages works just as well, if not better, for the TOEFL.\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to get in touch for language tutoring in Brooklyn (Brooklyn Public Library) or Manhattan (NY Public Library)!",

            "FreeResponse": "Hello! My name is Christie and I am on Wyzant to tutor students in the Spanish language and culture. If you are interested in learning Spanish, I would love to help by creating lessons that fit your individual learning needs and practicing everyday conversation. If you are a student in school and are unsure of the assigned homework, I would also be happy to correct grammatical mistakes or help find ways to remember the difference between certain concepts. We can either practice online or meet at a local library, coffee place, etc.\n\nI have a BA in Spanish language and culture and am currently a Spanish teacher at a local language immersion school. My fluency level has been confirmed through the national STAMP test. In the past four years, I have studied under total immersion in Spain and Ecuador, as well as volunteered in Panama. This past November, I spent some time traveling through Guatemala and plan to travel through Cuba in the coming year. In my spare time, I tutor adults in the Spanish language from a grammatical standpoint, but also incorporate fun activities to help children learn the language more naturally.\n\nEnglish is my native language. In the morning, I work for another company, specifically teaching English to Chinese students through online classes. I have also volunteered as an English language tutor for refugees through the Pinellas Refugee Education Program.\n\nNo matter what challenges a student may come across, I believe that anyone can learn another language. It is important to be polite with yourself while learning something new and to know that everyone learns in their own way. Together, we will find the way that you learn best and that is how our lessons will become organized.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions. We can discuss your specific interests in the language and tailor a lesson plan before our actual lessons begin.",

I am currently a middle school head counselor, but taught elementary and middle school for 10 years of my career. At the elementary level, I both wrote and taught curriculum. In addition, I taught bilingual/ESL classes and served as the bilingual facilitator for the campus. I successfully prepared students for the state test. I taught math and reading using a research based program from Johns Hopkins University. In middle school, I provided instruction in science and character education.\r\n\r\n I received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Interdisciplinary studies with a bilingual/ESL endorsement from Texas State University, a Masters in Counseling from UTSA, and completed coursework for my administrative certification at Lamar University.\r\n\r\nMy teaching fields enable me to provide excellent support for students in multiple subjects. My counseling experience has enabled me to build positive rapport with everyone with whom I come into contact. Often, my students need self-confidence boosts, study skills, and positive learning experiences in addition to the teaching of the material. In my experience, quality learning occurs when educators teach students, rather than simply content. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being fluent in English and Spanish, I have my Bilingual/ESL teaching certification in the state of Texas. My counseling skills have also helped me empathize and help students adjust to coming to a new country, with the academic and emotional hurdles. I have developed numerous strategies for assisting student in bridging the gap, both as a teacher and counselor.\r\n\r\nI have spoken, read and written Spanish from a very young age. I completed Spanish coursework in Middle School and was able to take credit by exam to receive 16 hours college credit in Spanish. \r\n\r\nWith many years of training in test taking strategies as well as preparing my students for standardized tests with impressive results, I am quite familiar with the process. Moreover, I have served as a test administrator and campus test coordinator.\r\n\r\nI am a certified teacher with years of experience in the classroom.\r\n\r\nI am excited at the prospect of tutoring students of varied needs.

            "FreeResponse": "I am working on a double major in English-Linguistics and Anthropology with a minor in Spanish. I worked for an Education Center as a preschool and elementary math and English tutor, as well as at the University of Nevada, Reno Writing Center where I helped students ranging from doctoral candidates to ESL students work on improving their writing at every stage and in any context. Furthermore, I freelanced as a linguistics tutor while working closely with a supervising professor and as a private tutor for an African immigrant/ graduate student.\r\n\r\nBut I do not do this for the money. I do it because I love it. In addition to my paid work, I have volunteered as a tutor multiple times. In high school I lead independent study groups helping students prep for the AP U.S. History and the AP Biology exams. In college, a friend and I organized a study session the hour before my introductory linguistics class to assist struggling students as well as an intense day-long study group the day of the final exam. Tutoring/teaching isn't simply something I do, it is something I am.\r\n\r\nAs indicated above, I worked as an elementary math tutor for Best in Class. I have also volunteering in an elementary school classroom where I helped 4th graders with fractions, multiplication, division, etc. Furthermore, I am great with kids, having babysat and volunteered in childcare ever since middle school.\r\n\r\nI adore anthropology, and I have ever since I was a little girl. Now as an anthropology tutor, I can help others understand and appreciate what makes this field so great. I have taken all introductory courses and at least one upper level course in all four major subfields of anthropology: cultural, archaeology, biological, and linguistic. I was also very involved in both the Anthropology and the Linguistics club on campus, holding  many officer positions  including president of both clubs. Furthermore, my current career plan is to get a PhD and teach anthropology/linguistics at the university level, so this is right up my alley.\r\n\r\nI have taken Spanish formally ever since the sixth grade, and am now minoring in it. I have supplemented my coursework with private pen-pals and conversation partners in Spanish, as well as regular refreshments on my grammar and vocabulary during the summer and other vacations. I even have used my conversational skills in the workplace. I also know of a plethora of opportunities and resources that I myself have used over the course of my tutelage.   \r\n\r\nI have loved to read and write ever since I could read and write. Not only that I love tutoring in reading and writing. Working at the university's Writing Center was one of the most fulfilling jobs I ever had, and as a former consultant I know where to find the resources that have been backed by the Center as having proven positive results for writers. Also as a linguistics major, I have a unique  perspective on the English language and can address why students are confused in regards to grammar, syntax, etc. and why it should be this or that way instead. I also have a strong background in literacy criticism and rhetoric, so if you're struggling to understand what is expected of  you I strongly encourage you to get in touch with me. If you are having trouble with the basics of the English language and formal grammar, I have also tutored English for ESL students and for elementary students.\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you think I can help you to achieve YOUR academic and life goals, if you want a tutor who treats you like the INDIVIDUAL you are with your own unique style of learning, or if you want a tutor who is passionate, supportive, qualified, and excellent with children I encourage you to message me so we can start embarking on our journey together.

Whatever has you bummed out--studying and remembering vocab, conjugating verbs in the preterite tense, or trying to decide whether or not you should use the subjunctive--are all things that will come to you with ease once you find an explanation that makes sense to you. I'm dedicated to approaching your areas of difficulty from a variety of angles and with multiple resources until we find one that makes sense to you. Don't be afraid; chances are, you are very good at Spanish and it is not too hard for you. \n\nI am a native Korean and English speaker, a near native Spanish speaker, and a cellist. I've been studying Spanish since 2007, and since then have taken all of the required courses for my major. I scored 770 on the SAT subject test for Spanish, and received scores of 5 on both the AP Spanish Language and Composition and AP Spanish Literature tests. I have had several opportunities to translate professionally. \n\nFeel free to contact me with any additional questions or to schedule a lesson! I'm easy to reach and quite flexible with my hours!",

My training in linguistics and foreign languages gives me the skills to understand how students learn languages.\n\nI have traveled to several Spanish-speaking countries, including Spain, Peru, and Mexico.

Students also learn to look at the world differently by studying different cultures.  \n\nWriting is one of my favorite subjects to teach. In graduate school, I assisted in writing instruction and helped dozens of new college students improve their writing skills. Writing is important not just for school, but also for a lifetime of communicating ideas to others. With practice and patience, students can learn to communicate their ideas to other people.\n\nI have also served as a volunteer tutor for adult learners of English as a Second Language. Although English can be a hard language to learn, it can be learned in steps.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like help with understanding literature. I have studied both English and Spanish literature and am familiar with literary themes and criticism.\n\nTo ensure a safe environment I prefer to meet at a school or library.

I feel comfortable developing my own lessons or helping students with assignments that they received in school. I also am very familiar with many of the NYS Regents exams as well as reading and writing skills for college readiness. \r\n\r\nMost important of all is helping students develop their own organizational skills and study routines to ensure future success and self-reliance.

I am studying for a career in obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN).  \r\n\r\nI grew up in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.  My undergraduate education was at Oberlin College, in Oberlin, Ohio.  I majored in both Neuroscience and Biology, and I minored in Chemistry.  At Oberlin, I was an active tutor in both the Departments of Neuroscience and Biology.  Additionally, I was a learning instructor for the Department of Neuroscience for one semester.  I helped create lesson plans two to three times a week to help those in the introductory Neuroscience course outside of the lecture, as well as practice questions and tests for students.  I also worked for the Department of Disability Services, where I aided in taking notes to those with disabilities.  \r\n\r\nFinally at Oberlin, I was a track and field athlete where I participated in the 100m, 200m, and 400m dash.  I was named an Academic All-American during my junior year of college for my participation and success in the 4 x 400 meter relay.\r\n\r\nI always say if I were not in medical school, I would pursue a career in teaching.  I love teaching and that feeling of seeing a student finally understand and master a difficult subject.  I try to use my tutoring and teaching experience when I educate my patients throughout medical school.  I hope to pursue a career in academic medicine in order to incorporate teaching into my practice.\r\n\r\nI majored in both Neuroscience and Biology, so I feel that I prepared to aid in tutoring in these subjects.  Additionally, being a medical student, I have a vast knowledge of anatomy and physiology.\r\n\r\nI took four years of High School Spanish, and continue to work with my Spanish speaking patients and often serve as a translator for my team.  I feel qualified to help teach Introductory Spanish for beginners.\r\n\r\nGoing to a liberal arts school, I had to prepare numerous papers and essays as the college had a focus on well rounded learning.  I feel qualified to help students when writing and preparing essays and personal statements, particularly for jobs, college applications, etc.\r\n\r\nI participated in Track and Field at the Collegiate level (Division III), where I received Academic All American as well as many conference and school awards.  I participated in the 100m, 200m, and 400m dash, as well as relays.  I feel most qualified to help in sprinting events.\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me for any additional information!",

For foreign languages I specialize in Spanish, and for computer programming I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL , Microsoft word, excel and powerpoint.\r\n\r\nMy approach is student-centered, providing guidance and support through the learning process. I organize my sessions by combining practical, hands-on examples with theory, in which students play an active and participatory role. The material that I prepare guides the student by answering questionnaires or following investigation guides that can be completed based on the lessons  that I present or on self-research.\r\n\r\nMath has been my favorite subject through all my life. Since middle school I became a teacher for my peers. They praised my teaching skills and understood my approach better than the teacher's. Later It became an important part of my professional career.\r\n\r\nSpanish is my native language.

            "FreeResponse": "I grew up as the child, niece, and granddaughter of three teachers. Nonetheless, at school I was also the hardworking nerd who spent more time studying than the rest and for whom repetition, encouragement, and opportunity were essential to my academic success—and confidence. It makes perfect sense to me that some five years after high school I would return to the very setting that had been the site of my growth.\n\nBeginning in 2008, I served as an outdoor educator with elementary school students. Since then, I have conducted environmental education aboard floating barges and canyon tops, exciting high schoolers, middle schoolers, adults, and those with developmental and behavioral issues. In 2011, I worked as a student volunteer coordinator at an immigrant center. Each weekend I developed and adapted an ESL curriculum to suit the needs of a  wide array of adult Hispanic immigrants. Some were consistent students throughout the year, and we were able to progress from their native Spanish to English-only lessons. In 2012, I student-taught Spanish to two classes of fifth and ninth grade, developing lesson plans, assessments, and offering extra help as needed. In 2014, while at the Prague Film School, I merged my passions for education and storytelling by directing two child actors for one of my favorite films. More recently, in 2016, I served as a youth programmer for ages two to eighteen, working to develop eight distinct weeks of outdoor, spiritual, and arts-related curricula for both local, low-income minority students, as well as families arriving from across the country. \n\nWhat I most love about tutoring is the opportunity to develop a trusting, open-minded relationship with a younger person based on a shared desire for understanding. I always say that as a teacher, I do not know best; only by addressing the specific needs of my students can I be of the greatest help. Young folks generally have both an eagerness and flexibility that make them easy to work with; plus, in pairing a variety of learning routines with regular, empathetic communication, I can help them make relevant associations, find a routine that best works for them, and rouse their curiosity about the subjects that give them the most trouble. Among the best qualities that I can offer as a tutor are my patience, compassion, and willingness to try a new approach. I really look forward to meeting all the capable students out there who are willing to make a go of something initially difficult, but readily achievable.\n\nNadya is a graduate of Wesleyan University with a Bachelor’s in English. She received an 800 on her SAT Writing section, a 750 on her Critical Reading section, and has written a 40-page Senior Essay in the form of a creative nonfiction family memoir. Nadya speaks three languages and knows how difficult it can be to develop an aptitude for it; she uses memory tricks, drama, pop culture references and images to help students (and herself!) remember grammar rules and vocabulary.\n\nAs someone who grew up exposed to Spanish and Russian, studied Spanish for nine years, received her high school’s Foreign Language Award for Spanish in 2011, taught English to recent Hispanic immigrants in 2012, and acquired a 760 on her Spanish SAT subject test, Nadya is excited to offer her skills in Spanish to any student in need of tutoring.\n\nPlease message me for more information or to schedule a session. Looking forward to meeting all of your smiling faces... :)",

            "FreeResponse": "I have always had one foot in the education sphere, whether it's being a student myself, working with kids in daycare as an assistant or being responsible for a class of my own. Recently, I had the wonderful opportunity to use my degrees in English literature and Spanish to teach second grade at a bilingual school located in the beautiful green mountains of Matagalpa, Nicaragua. This was a unique experience due to the fact that this was the school's first year. Therefore, my classroom was rather small and I was able to individualize my curriculum to fit my students' needs. Through this past year's experience abroad, my passion for teaching English as a second language and English literature has only grown. I have also gained a strong desire to connect with others through Spanish speaking abilities that I have enhanced while living abroad. I have returned eagerly seeking an opportunity to continue fostering young and older minds in these areas of study and feel that tutoring would be the best format for achieving this. \n\nApart my experience as a second grade teacher at a bilingual primary school this past year, I graduated from the University of Oregon in Spring of 2015 as cum laude and was the recipient of an award for an analytical essay I wrote. Needless to say, I have a strong passion for reading and writing both creatively and analytically that are key to being successful in this field. These qualities demonstrate that I am a suitable match for a wide variety of students seeking to further their studies in English whether it be by brushing up on the rules of English grammar, expanding their vocabulary or improving their writing and reading in English. \n\nAlong with my degree in English, I also have a degree in Spanish from the University of Oregon. I entered the university with 5 years of Spanish, experience traveling abroad and left with good grades in all of my classes and further experience studying abroad for two trimesters in the beautiful city of Seville, Spain. Through previous work experience, I have improved my Spanish speaking abilities, but I feel as if this past year has made me much more adept in the field as I was required to collaborate with coworkers and supervisors completely in Spanish. I also have taken conversation classes since graduating that have ensured that I am continuing to enhance my Spanish speaking, reading and writing abilities. Now with 10+ years of studying Spanish, I am ready to assist others with developing this skill. \n\nIf you are looking for an opportunity to improve your English and Spanish skills as well as some good conversation then please do not hesitate to contact me! I am thrilled to have this experience to connect with others in the community and discuss these two areas of study that I am passionate about.",

I have a Bachelors degree in Illustration from OCAD University. I enjoy connecting with my students and helping them come to conclusions on their own about their assignments. I love to see others learn and understand concepts, enhancing their skills to further them in any area they are working on. I focus on study skills rather than just teaching concepts. I will be your guide along the way, ready to support you and cheer you on; making sure you know that there is no problem with making mistakes. Mistakes are the easiest way to learn.\r\n\r\nI have experience teaching in a Private school with classrooms with up to 35 students, as well as tutoring one-on-one private classes (both online and live sessions).

I can't wait to put to use the skills I have developed throughout my years to tutor you in my areas of knowledge. Looking forward to meeting you! :D\r\n\r\nI offer classes tailored to each student specific needs. Taking into account that every student is different, and what works with someone may not work with another student. I am extremely flexible and open to any suggestion you may have. My main concern is that my students are happy and are able to see improvements as we move along.\r\n\r\nI have a special focus on study skills. What I enjoy the most is to teach my students how to find the information on their own, how to approach a subject. Teaching them methods of studying and understanding, rather than just telling them what to do, or giving them the answers.\r\n\r\nI provide lots of empathy for problems with anxiety and struggles in finding their way. My main goal is for my students to feel comfortable, and for them to know that if they are not getting it now, they eventually will, we just have to find their own path, together.",

If you are studying for the ACT or SAT, I can assist you in preparing yourself for the English and verbal sections of those tests. Additionally, I can assist you in understanding poetry and other literary works by introducing you to the methods of literary analysis.\n\nI do prefer to conduct my tutoring online.\nI look forward to hearing from you and helping you to achieve success in your studies!",

I helped my wife teach our children and taught in a formal setting, in Catechism classes, at St. Jerome Catholic Church.  In addition, I've been answering questions about Catholicism, on the internet, for about 15 years.  I have written various articles on Catholicism.\n\nAs well as teaching the Catechism, I am well versed in teaching the Bible, the history of the Catholic Church, Comparative theology (i.e. the differences) between Catholicism, Judaism, Protestantism and Islam, Sacramental theology, and Soteriology.  \n\nI am well qualified to teach Bible courses, because I have studied the Bible for about twenty years in order to answer questions posed by my students and online inquirers.\n\nI wanted to teach the Catholic Faith, because, when I was a young boy, I lost my faith in God.  I became an atheist.  Many years later, I had what many call a conversion experience.  This conversion changed my life profoundly and I began to search for God in the many religions of the world.  I believe I made a very thorough search which, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, led me back to the Catholic Church.  I don't want other children to go the same path and lose their faith.  Therefore, I have a very strong desire to teach the Word of God.\n\nI love to teach the Catholic Faith to all concerned.  I hope that you will contact me and that we can have a grace filled journey to understand the Teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.  \n\nSincerely,  \nJuan",

For example, I gave up on my ability to learn Spanish after my high school classes but now I am fluent. \n\nMy wife and I raised 6 children together. During our Summers we traveled as a family to several Latin American countries and all of us now speak some level of Spanish. I was a practicing attorney for 28 years mostly because it's hard to raise a large family on a teacher's salary. But teaching is what I love and always loved the most! \n\nI recently returned from Mexico where my job was to work with hundreds of young people from all over the world but mostly from Mexico and Central and South America. None of them spoke English, so I had to improve my Spanish, both to help them and to live in and find our way around Mexico City, a city with more than 28 million residents and automobiles to match. \n\nWhen I returned, I decided not to practice law again and instead teach Spanish in the local high school district. I taught as a Substitute Teacher during the past year (2016-2017) and became the \"go to\" substitute for 4 of the Spanish teachers. It was fun to go to work every day!\n\nIf you think that my background will help you to either learn or just to brush up on your Spanish, then I would enjoy being your tutor. Please just reach out to me and we will coordinate a tutoring session at a time which respects your busy schedule.",

            "FreeResponse": "As a native Spanish speaker, an English language learner, the parent of two bilingual children, and an English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher, I have experienced first-hand the do’s and don’ts of acquiring a new language. It is very important to focus on all language areas: reading, writing, conversational and presentational speaking, as well as listening. However, foreign language instruction also involves teaching about local and global Spanish communities, making connections between subject areas while problem solving and using critical thinking skills, comparing English and Spanish in order to note similarities between words, and learning about cultural items, points of view, and customs. An outstanding Spanish tutor should not only be able to teach certain content but teach it effectively. In order to make learning a new language fun and engaging, I instruct through a wide range of teaching strategies that involve active learning in order to positively impact all types of students. That is why I make sure to target students’ learning styles and multiple intelligences, when appropriate, through the presentation of content, lesson activities, and assessments that are tailored to individual student needs. \r\n\r\nMore than a decade of living in Miami, Florida and communicating with parents of English language learners has provided me with extensive exposure to individuals from various Latin American countries. These experiences have definitively made a large contribution to my Spanish repertoire of country-specific words and phrases along with multiple translation work assignments. These direct experiences have also added to my cultural knowledge of similarities and differences between Latin American countries. Also contributing to my knowledge of Spanish language, history, and culture is my Master of Arts in Latin American and Caribbean Studies from Florida International University.  \r\n\r\nMy extensive 7-year experience working with students of all ages has consisted of both teaching and tutoring. Also helpful are my certifications in various language-related areas: Spanish (K-12), English Language Arts (7-12), Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Education (K-12), and Elementary Education (K-6). While studying to become a teacher, I worked briefly as an ELA (English Language Arts) teacher's aide and tutor at a Miami high school while working for the GEAR UP program. In the Spring of 2004, I tutored students at another Miami high school for FIU Academy, a mentorship program. The following Spring, I completed my internship at Southwest Miami Senior High School where I taught ninth grade English Language Arts (Regular and Honors). A year later, I subbed temporarily for a reading position at an inner-city high school in the Tampa Bay area. Afterwards, I spent about a year tutoring at a Sylvan center also in the Tampa Bay area. When I moved back to Miami, I worked as a tutor for Club-Z!, a tutoring company. Once I moved to Lafayette Parish, I was hired as an ESL (English as a Second Language) elementary teacher in a rural school where I worked for 4 years. As a college professor in Louisiana, I taught ELA courses for a year. I recently worked as an ESL elementary teacher in Colorado Springs, but I feel that Spanish is what I am most passionate about teaching and where my new journey as an educator is taking me. \r\n\r\nLearning Spanish is definitely beneficial in order to have access to a larger piece of the global workplace in the 21st century. Spanish is the 2nd most spoken language by native speakers in the world. It is spoken in 44 countries. The new American workplace also requires not just technological savvy but the ability to communicate effectively while working in groups. Spanish is definitely an asset in this new workplace, allowing increased communication with both coworkers and customers. In addition, it is the 2nd most widely spoken language in the United States. Presently, Latinos and Hispanics comprise the largest minority group in the United States. Speaking to this point is a well-known Nelson Mandela quote: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.”\r\n",

            "FreeResponse": "I'm Corey, I am majoring in Spanish at the University of Cincinnati.  I'm still working on getting my degree but I consider myself to be efficient in the Spanish language.  I lived in Valencia, Spain twice throughout my life to study.  The second time I lived there was to go to the University of Valencia for a study abroad program.  I started studying the Spanish language as a freshman in High School back in 2008.  Since then my love for the language has been growing and today I help others to learn the language or help those that can only speak Spanish.  \r\n\r\nI started teaching English as a second language with Butler Tech in 2014.  I applied for this position when I got back from my spring semester in Spain.  My classes were primarily Spanish speaking individuals and I was able to help them learn English no matter what the students levels were.  This is where my teaching/tutoring experience comes from but along the way I've been able to apply the help towards Spanish students at my local High School.\r\n\r\nWhat I love most about tutoring is the \"aha\" moment that the students have.  When one may struggle with a concept such as subjunctive or conjugation of verbs, they finally grasp it after the struggle and it's as if something clicked and the student finally understands it.  To help others learn is something that is a passion of mine and I hope to have the opportunity to extend that to my community.  \r\n\r\nI enjoy helping others to learn the language.  With this I teach in a different way in order to help the student understand the different concepts.\r\n\r\nI'm always willing to tutor those in need.  It doesn't matter if you know a single word or if you are working on Pluscuamperfecto, I'm available.  Feel free to contact me with any questions or to schedule a lesson.",

I have also been a teacher to students of all ages, which is something I enjoy doing, and is the reason why I am interested and excited about tutoring.\r\n\r\nI believe that a good teacher is one that is knowledgeable in the subject he or she teaches, cares about students, and makes learning fun, interesting, and challenging. I have achieved great results by using all these elements into each of my lessons. I believe in the learning- by-doing approach, in teaching language by practicing with the four areas of any language acquisition, which are reading, writing, listening, and speaking in order to achieve  mastery and of the subject.\r\n\r\nI am a good Spanish tutor because I have many years of experience teaching the subject, and I am passionate not only about the topic but my students.\r\n\r\nI have a masters degree in education with emphasis in Spanish and Latin American studies, I have 25 years experience teaching Spanish at different levels to high school, college level, and adult students interested in learning the language and culture of Spanish speaking countries. I am also a National Board Certified teacher on the area of World Language other than English, and of course I am a native Spanish speaker. I have helped thousands of students understand, practice, and learn all facets of the Spanish language. \r\n\r\nI am excited about helping you learn and use the Spanish language in a fun and interesting way. If you are one who needs extra help in school, or just want to refresh your prior knowledge of Spanish, because you plan to travel to a Spanish speaking country, or because this is something you always wanted to do. I want to make you more confident in your ability to do so.\r\nPlease contact me, I will be happy to promptly respond to your inquiries.",

I focus on the educational needs of the members who attend the program. I teach large groups and work individually with members to raise their academic skill levels. It is still my delight to coach students to academic success- adults as well as young learners. I tutor a wide variety of subjects.\n\nI am available for On-line Tutoring. If you are local (in the Nashville area), I will tutor in-person. I am available Fridays and weekends and specialize in test prep.\n\nThank you for your time.\n \nI look forward to working with you & your student.\n\nCody",

            "FreeResponse": "I am a junior undergraduate of Classical Languages at UMass Boston. I've studied Latin for 10 years, starting in Boston Latin Academy. My express interest in language and culture brought me to be fluent and skilled in English writing, Spanish, and Japanese. While at both institutions, I've tutored fellow colleagues and newer students in Latin and Ancient Greek. My tutoring experience ranges from schoolwide tutoring departments, referrals from parents and professors, and casual teaching at a quiet cafe. Group tutoring sessions are efficient in that they encourage dialogue and remove anxieties about learning. Students are pleased at the patience, organization, and thoroughness that I use to tutor.\nMy main concern for each student is that they succeed in their language learning and earn high grades. This can be done with the variety of methods: memorization, drilling, guided reading, and conversation (not required for Latin), among others. Students have learned to use beneficial studying habits at home based on my tutoring. All of these methods create a fun, competitive yet stress-free environment for the student. I am a friendly, professional, and enthusiastic tutor who will guarantee that you will have fun learning a new language if you are a high school student or adult.\n\nI tutor in Elementary, Intermediate and Advanced Latin. Aside from language, I have an adequate knowledge of Roman history, culture, and literature. I have three years experience of speaking Latin at a conversational level and though it serves my own proficiency, students will not be tutored this way unless it is required (Orberg, LLPSI). I tutor Elementary and Intermediate Ancient Greek, Attic dialect.\nI speak Spanish at home and work and am very fluent in grammar, composition, and conversation.\n\nYou or your student will see that tutoring with me will be as comfortable as studying with a peer yet as efficient as a private lesson with a teacher. I encourage students to contact me with whatever language difficulty that they have and a place in Boston where they feel most comfortable studying. My availability on Mon., Wed., Fri., and Sat. vary but do not hesitate to ask about my availability. I look forward to seeing you!",

            "FreeResponse": "Dear Prospective Students,\n\nI am a Spanish teacher at Floresville High School. I teach seven (7) sections of Spanish 1; my students are primarily freshmen, but there are some upperclassmen sprinkled into the mix. I enjoy my teaching career very much and I love the Spanish language! I love to fill my summers assisting students with Spanish. I have worked with all ages of students: middle school to adult; and all proficiency levels.\n\nI am originally from a small town in Illinois, but have lived in Texas for more than 20 years; Austin for 18 years, San Antonio for three and Floresville for the last three. I began studying Spanish in 9th grade just like many of my students. I liked learning the language so much, I majored in it at the university. My husband and I are proud parents of a 5-year old daughter. We have two dogs and a cat. We spend our time taking our little girl to do fun things!\n\nI earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in Spanish Language from The University of Texas at Austin and my Masters in Education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. This is my 16th year in Education. I am certified in Texas in Spanish, English as a Second Language, Bilingual Education, and English; I also have my principal's certification. While I was a student at UT, I studied at the Universidad Catolica del Ecuador. I have traveled in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Nicaragua, and I have led groups of my high school students on two excursions to Spain. (These were incredible experiences!) I have taught in Round Rock, Edgewood and North East ISDs, and I worked with high school ESL students and teachers through a program at The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nMy goals for my Spanish classes and Spanish tutoring lessons are: to assist the students in acquiring the desired level of language proficiency; as well as to promote a love of learning languages, an understanding of the importance of learning other languages, and an understanding of culture's role in language learning. I also work to help students with organizational skills.\n\nMy Spanish tutoring sessions are catered to the needs of the student. I am an excellent teacher of all aspects of the Spanish language - from oral communication to grammar help or explanations and practice with textbook assignments.\n\nAs a classroom teacher, my class involves a lot of communicative activities in which the students use the language through games and dialogues. I assign homework occasionally to ensure that students are practicing the language outside of class. I focus on positive reinforcement for classroom management, and I follow the campus behavior plan. I expect students to arrive on time to class, to be prepared with materials and assignments, to participate in all class activities, and to behave respectfully everyday. I do my best to reward and reinforce excellence, as well as improvement! One of our class mottos is, \"Work Hard, Get Smart!\"\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns, I am always available to you via Wyzant. Thank you very much for supporting your student's success in Spanish. I look forward to studying together!\n\nSincerely,\nJulie M.",

I am a bilingual, native Spanish speaker from Puerto Rico and a passionate language, literature, and culture teacher with extensive experience educating and tutoring at the college and adult level.     \n\nWhat I love the most about tutoring is the act of sharing my knowledge with other folks and helping them to accumulate knowledge and think critically. Furthermore, I bring to the table positive energy and lots of enthusiasm.   Education is power!\n\nI have lived in the United States for the past 16 years: I first did an M.A. at the University of Chicago and then a Ph.D. at New York University, concentrating on Latin American literatures and cultures.  After finishing my doctoral degree. I taught for two years at Harvard University as a College Fellow and then at the University of Pittsburgh, thanks to a Postdoctoral Fellowship.  I began my teaching career in 2012, when I organized a thesis seminar for undergraduate students, assisting them with their research and writing.   After taking a class dedicated to language teaching methodologies at New York University, I taught Spanish language classes for five years while finishing my PhD at the same university.  In teaching literature and culture courses in English and in Spanish at Harvard and Pitt, I have also developed my pedagogical skills in teaching writing in both languages.   At the same time, I have tutored students and adults who were either preparing to take Spanish proficiency exams, improve their grades, or just wanting to refine their language skills.    \n\nAs a bilingual, native speaker of Spanish who learned English as a second language at the elementary and high school level and then had to take the TOEFL to enter the University of Chicago and New York University, I understand very well the complex processes of learning ESL and preparing for the TOEFL exam.  These experiences have helped me develop the necessary tools for helping students succeed in these areas.    My extensive training in comparative literature--learning and writing about subjects that interconnect American, Western European, and Latin American literature--also makes me an excellent candidate for assisting students in literature and writing. \n\nI am fully bilingual and a native speaker of Spanish, skills that help make a language tutor distinguished.  In teaching language and grammar for five years, I cultivated strategies to make learning more fun, active, and productive.    And because of my experience teaching different levels of students and folks with different sets of demands, I can easily adapt to your personal learning style and educational needs.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and would be more than happy to answer any questions you might have.  ¡Saludos!",

            "FreeResponse": "I have taught Spanish and French at the High School level, offered Haitian Creole, English, Spanish and French in small groups and online. I interpreted and translated assignments for Spanish-speaking students in order to clarify assignment materials and accommodated students with physical and visual disabilities with computer-related assignments. I independently planned and taught ESL classes to tourism service providers in Cartagena. And through my advice, despite being far from them I have been helping my students who I considered as a second family.\r\nBeing able to help someone, sharing knowledge with an individual and seeing the progress made by my students make me love tutoring. \r\nI received two certificates for ESL teaching in Colombia which are the following:\r\n1) Participation at Immersion for learning English as a second language with Travel4Change. \r\n2) Teaching of English as a second language emphasized on Tourism\r\nI strengthened the development of tourism through the reinforcement of Bilingualism in different populations, reinforced English skills of tourism service providers in Cartagena's industry such as tour guides, service providers and improved the levels of that second language and enhanced this population's professionalism in the touching industry. I taught English through multiculturalism while building relationships with the end-goal of expanding knowledge experience and cultural diversity by promoting a society with greater tolerance of difference, participated at an academic training where Colombian teachers of English increased their knowledge through workshops that allowed a 100 % immersion so that they could improve their skills and so they would perfect their level of English. I taught at College Mayor de Bolívar, Colombia, from January 2017 to July 2017. For three weeks in July 2017, I also participated as a volunteer instructor in an English-language immersion for Colombian high school teachers in Tocancipa, Colombia. In details I completed and received a certificate for an one-week intensive orientation and pedagogical training in the city of Bogotá under the instruction of renowned teacher-training institute UNICA (Institución Universitaria Colombo Americana), independently planned and gave ESL classes to tourism service providers in my placement city of Cartagena, and turned in monthly reports and attendance databases to a National Coordinator.\r\nTo start off, French and Haitian Creole are my native languages. I have been studying Spanish for 12 years now, did a major in that romance language at the State University at Albany, and took intensive classes for 11 months in Costa Rica at Universidad VERITAS and at Universidad De Costa Rica, Sede Occidente in San Ramon and lives in Colombia for 7 months. \r\nMy expertise in those following four languages : Haitian Creole, French, Spanish and English, my consistency, persistence of practicing with my students, the ability of understanding the cognitive aspects of my students make me a great language teacher and tutor. \r\nIf you are interested in learning French, Spanish, English or Haitian Creole, please take a class. I promise, I'll make it super educational and fun! :) \r\nWe will discuss in the future about scheduling lessons.\r\n",

However, I'm also fluent in Spanish thanks to my amazing experience living in Andalucia, Spain. I learned Spanish by living with a Spanish family working as a live-in nanny. I then got a full time English teaching job at a school teaching from age 2 to adults. \n\nSoy Alyssa de los estados unidos. El inglés es mi idioma materno pero aprendí el español viviendo en España por casi 3 años. Allí trabajaba como maestra de inglés en una academia. Tengo experiencia enseñando el ingles a los niños de 2-3 años hasta los adultos. Si tienes ganas de aprender o mejor tu nivel de ingles, no dudes en ponerte en contacto conmigo!\n\nI am finishing my bachelor's degree in Spanish & French and I am also a Spanish tutor at the university. I truly love teaching both English and Spanish because I personally understand the process of learning a language.  \n\nI know how difficult it can be but also how rewarding it is once you see the progress. So, don't hesitate to get in contact with me, whether you wish for you or your child to learn Spanish.\n\nBefore going to Spain I had studied years of Spanish in high school and college however, I was still unable to speak it at a conversational level. From living with Spaniards and having to survive day to day, I worked very hard to learn the language. I am now completely fluent both verbally, and at a written level.\n\nI understand the process of learning a language and especially the difficulties that come a long with learning Spanish as a native English speaker. Because of this, I am able to provide the best tips and help when teaching the language.\n\nIts never too early nor too late to learn a language, and once you do you will be forever grateful!

I am Chemical Engineer with an MD in Computer Applied to Chemical Engineering.  I have more than 25 years of teaching experience.\r\nI have taught 5 years old through 80 years old students from elementary to undergraduate to engineering students to teachers and professionals.  I am passionate about teaching students and forge relationships with them that help build a sense of confidence and enable them to grow as learners.\r\n\r\nAs a student teacher, I created lessons that engaged all learners by applying a variety of teaching methods and utilizing technology resources always. Classroom computers present unique opportunities to help each student achieve success. I formed cooperative learning groups, organized individualized projects, created learning centers and implemented learning style research in every lesson. Alternative assessment methods, such as portfolios, rubrics and performance assessments, in combination with traditional tests, enabled me to evaluate the students individually and comprehensively.\r\n\r\nBesides teaching, I conducted research in engineering projects, wrote books, developed formulas to produce chemical products.  I am always interested in learning more and more.\r\n\r\nI've started tutoring students in elementary school in my country.  Then I tutored students in middle and high school in Barcelona, where I studied my master's after receiving a scholarship awarded by Instituto de Cooperacion Iberoamericana in Spain.\r\n\r\nMy career as educator continued here in the United States of America when I started as a substitute teacher in Hillsborough County Public Schools.  Then as a certified teacher I taught Spanish to freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior students. I was recognized  and received the Certificate of Excellence for outstanding performance and lasting contribution during the 2007-2008 school year by Sunshine Committee.  I still remember those days in the school when my students enjoyed learning a foreign language and applying in every real situation in their lives.\r\n\r\nIn both my student teaching and tutoring experiences, I met with parents to keep them apprised of their child's accomplishments and areas needing extra attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy quote: Education is a progressive discovery of our ignorance\"    Will Durant (1885-1981)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "FreeResponse": "I attended Oklahoma Christian University to study Mechanical Engineering in 2007. In 2009, I began tutoring in an on-campus tutoring office and fell in love with tutoring. I graduated in December of 2011, but decided to continue pursuing private tutoring. I'm often asked why I don't pursue something relevant to my degree, but tutoring is what I love. Whether it's a student improving their grades so that they can get into a better college, or just seeing a student's confidence increase when they start mastering material, this entire job is magical. \n\nIn the tutoring office on campus, many of the students I helped were disadvantaged, and our program was mandatory for any students that were admitted with an ACT score below 18. Many of the students that came through that office would only stay in college for one year, but many more would learn how to manage their time and gain the confidence they needed to succeed and complete their degree. During my time in this tutoring office, I was told by several students that they'd always believed they were just too stupid and that they could never do college. Each one of those students would end up completing their degree, either at OC, or after transferring to another University. \n\nWhen it comes to subjects, Calculus and Physics are my absolute favorites, but I often tutor Algebra 1 & 2, College Algebra, Statistics, Geometry, Trigonometry, Chemistry, Physical Science, Spanish 1 & 2 (although I can usually stumble through up to Spanish 3), English & Writing, and History/Government. I prefer working 1-on-1 with students instead of splitting my attention, to make sure that the communication is clear and the concepts are understood. I work based on the idea that everybody is a genius, but if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree it will live its entire life believing that it is stupid. My goal is to translate the concept into whatever way makes the most sense so that anybody can master the skills for whatever course they are enrolled.\n\nI also try to be flexible with my 24-hour cancellation policy, because sometimes things happen that are beyond our control. If a cancellation happens I offer make-up classes on Friday afternoons and Saturdays. Please let me know as soon as possible if you need to cancel! \n\nStrong math and science skills are a requirement for a degree in engineering, and my school of engineering also placed a great deal of importance on communication. Because of this, I have helped many students from many walks of life excel in their classes\n\nIf you're looking for anything from a little extra help up to a secondary teacher/professor, please don't hesitate to contact me! I look forward to helping you!",

When I started college, I picked it up as my major (I had a great high school teacher) but quickly felt lost and bewildered in my first semester of general chemistry. My biggest mistake that first year was trying to do it on my own, and honestly, I didn't do very well. I gave up after two semesters and tried moving on to something else. But being away from it, I realized that I wasn't satisfied by quitting. Long story short, I switched my major back and although it took some time, I developed a passion for chemistry and I believe it had everything to do with attitude. Great opportunities came as a result, including an internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA. Currently I am working towards my doctorate at UH Manoa. \n\nDuring my senior year as an undergraduate, I served as the Chemistry Society President on our campus and planned activities/forums to help students overcome their fears of chemistry and collaborate in their studies. We helped launch a tutor lab, from which I gained teaching experience. I'm familiar with many concepts that students often struggle with. I can adapt to various learning styles by explaining with pictures, using analogies of real-life situations, or combining content from various sources to convey the large picture. Since the majority of students taking chemistry are on track to becoming future doctors, lawyers, or scientists, it is equally important to me that they succeed as it is to them. If you struggle grasping those beginning concepts like I did, or if those two semesters of P Chem are turning into the worst four semesters of your life, contact me soon!",

I have an MBA in International Business from North Central University of Arizona, and I hold a bachelor’s degree in Psychology with a minor in Interdisciplinary Studies obtained at Texas A&M University of Commerce. I chose Spanish as a minor in College, where I got to take courses such as Latin American Culture and Civilization, and Spanish Literature and Spanish Medieval Literature. It was the content and inspiring professors what made practice teaching; hoping to bring in students the same type of inspiration. It gives me a certain intrinsic satisfaction to contribute with someone’s understanding of such beautiful language as it is Spanish. \r\n\r\nConsequently, I taught Spanish III, IV, and V Advance Placement in a local High School in Dallas.  It was such a great experience and I will never forget nor regret it. I learned important things to be successful when teaching/tutoring students such as: Instruct through lectures, discussions and demonstrations in one or more subjects; establish clear objectives for all lessons, units and projects, and communicate those objectives to students, knowledge of current teaching methods and educational pedagogy, patience to work interactively with students using technology to compliment instruction in a classroom setting and ability to understand the individual needs of each student, among others. \r\n\r\nIn regards to TOEFL qualification, I worked as a Rater for the TOEFFL Exam. I scored essays everyday by using a rubric to apply scores consistently across multiple prompts. Raters read and score essays, maintaining accurate and consistent calibration. Raters receive extensive training; only those who successfully pass the mandated certification exam have the opportunity to score.\r\n\r\nI want to benefit students as much as I can, therefore I welcome any feedback or suggestions from students or parents.

I find it very rewarding when students answer me in Spanish, start a conversation, and enjoy learning it.\n\nI have been learning English for about 14 years. I am bilingual, I am doing my Masters in Romance Language in Spanish. Learning English is not easy, but it is not impossible! Students need to practice, study, and be exposed to English in order to learn it. \n\nI am a caring person that want to share my knowledge of Spanish and English to people that are interested in learning it. To learn a second language people need to be exposed to the second language and practice interacting with other people. \n\nIn addition, Spanish is not difficult to learn! You can learn it by being exposed to conversation, activities, music, and to practice Spanish with someone that knows the language. Spanish is important to expand your world and be able to know other cultures, travel, and communicate with others.  English is important to know because it opens the doors to many opportunities and to be able to communicate. \n\nI had a year of tutoring experience in college level Mathematics (Algebra)  working with students individually and in groups of 5-6 students. I help them to understand the material, organize their work, and support them to finish their work. Also, I tutored some students with Spanish lessons. I met with them after class and worked on compositions, grammar, and conversation.\n\nI am passionate about helping others to accomplish their goals in life.

            "FreeResponse": "I believe the path to success is knowledge. So not for a moment do I take for granted how important learning is. But not everything is easily learnable. In fact, learning a foreign language can be one of the most difficult and often times frustrating endeavors. More times than I can count did I feel as though just when I was getting to grips with Spanish, it would throw me a curve ball, and knock me back down. But obviously I was determined to learn Spanish because it’s so rewarding and most of all fun to speak a language that’s not your own.\n\nUnfortunately the education system doesn’t really teach Spanish the right ways. There is such a strong focus on reading and writing as oppose to speaking and most importantly listening. While reading and writing are important, especially to pass a test, learning to speak and hear Spanish is when your mind really makes the transition and the Spanish begins to come naturally. Fortunately enough, over the years I’ve had the opportunity to hone both my reading and writing Spanish skills as well as listening and speaking. After many long grueling hours at school, and many trips to Spanish speaking countries, I feel very confident with this language.\n\nSomething that often comes up when communicating with a Spanish speaker is their eagerness to learn English as well. During a conversation someone will ask you for instance what’s the difference between “who and whom” and honestly most of us native english speakers wouldn’t know the answer. Even if we did, you still have to accomplish communicating the difference to someone who doesn’t speak english natively. It seems simple but believe me it’s complicated. I can’t deny that Spanish is my greatest passion, but I’m also formally Educated in English as well, from grammar to essay writing.\n\nIf you’re looking for a Spanish tutor who is both passionate and knowledgeable, I would hope to have your consideration. On the flip side if you need someone to help build your confidence and hone your skills with all things English, I can help there too. At the end of the day, I’ve been there, I’ve done that, so I know firsthand the process of learning. I would love to use that knowledge to give back and help those who are so close but just need a little guidance to springboard them on their path to success.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.",

            "FreeResponse": "It's important for my students to understand my background.  I was born in Washington, DC but lived in Spain for over ten years and in Italy for two.  My mother is Spanish and my father is American, so I grew up constantly moving from one side of the cultural spectrum of the Western world to the other.  I feel very lucky to come from both places because I identify greatly with both worlds.  Sometimes it feels as if I can't connect to Spain or Italy when I'm in the States (and vice versa); that's where language comes in.  Language has always been the one connecting factor that has aided me in combining the two sides of my life and persona.  I started giving English lessons to my Spanish friends when I was fourteen and started earning money for them almost immediately, as they were in high demand in the small city I lived in on the Southern tip of Spain, Cadiz.  All of my classmates read and wrote beautifully, but when it came to speaking, they struggled immensely.  I loved the ability to share all facets of English as I watched my friends' eyes widen with excitement to learn more about a language and the meaning behind its many layers.  This only continued when I moved back to the States, as my American friends struggled with the same issue in regards to Spanish.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to Seville post high school graduation, I was hired at the Seville School of Languages to teach both Spanish and English to high school and college students.  After a year of working in Spain, I moved to California to pursue a degree at UC Santa Barbara for two years and then UC Los Angeles for two.  I was hired at Monte Vista Elementary School in Santa Barbara to run the After-School Spanish Program where I taught classes to elementary and junior high students.\r\nI recently graduated from UCLA and am currently pursuing a career in Acting as well as teaching Spanish and Yoga.  I greatly enjoy teaching because it gives me an opportunity to share what I'm passionate about while I continue to explore the ins and outs of language.  I've noticed that the love of teaching comes from a love of learning as well.  Each student has a different way of taking in and conveying information and all students teach me in a different way just as much, if not more, than I teach them. There is a special bond that forms through teaching and tutoring in which intellect and a one-on-one relationship find comfort in each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was born in America, my mother is from Italy and I spent most of my childhood and adolescence in Spain.  I lived in Italy for two years when I was young and always kept Italian up because of my mother.  English and Spanish are the languages I'm most comfortable in but Italian is one that holds a lot of meaning to me and I continue to practice it every chance I get.  My parents taught me the importance of language early on and encouraged me to study the three languages I was exposed to in every country I was residing in.  I have studied all three extensively in different formats throughout the entirety of my life.  Because all three languages mean so much to me and my roots, it is hard to consider the passing along of these languages work.  It feels wonderful to be able to share even a semblance of the ins and outs and complexities of Spanish, Italian, and English in the hopes that my students could learn to love one of these languages  and utilize it throughout their lives. \r\n\r\nI will always provide different accents/versions of the idioms based on where it is spoken and I believe that speaking is just as important (if not more so) than being able to write well.  I usually encourage a lot of accent work and speaking exercises so that students can feel fully immersed in the languages.\r\nThank you!",

            "FreeResponse": "My love of teaching comes from my many years of experience.   Ever since I entered Peace Corps Panama in 2005, I have been teaching.   At that time, I was teaching members of a coffee cooperative basic accounting skills in Panama.  As a secondary project, I began teaching English to students in the local high school.  After finishing Peace Corps, I had the opportunity to take the SIT TESOL (Teaching English to speakers of other languages)  course in Costa Rica, providing me with the necessary tools to be an even more effective teacher.  The course consisted of eight-five hours of instruction in methodology, twenty-eight hours of lesson planning, six and three quarter hours of individual assessed teaching, thirty-two hours of peer observation, three hours of observation of experienced ESL (English as a Second Language) teachers, and ten hours of feedback on my teaching.   By the end of the course, I was able to:\r\n\r\n-) Rigorously reflect on teaching decisions in terms of their effect on individual student learning.\r\n-) Plan for and effectively implement, and reflect upon language-centered learning.  \r\n-) Analyze, plan for, effectively teach and reflect upon language in terms of its meaning, form, and use.\r\n-) Plan, teach, and reflect on all stages of a productive skills lesson (Either speaking or writing.)\r\n-) Plan, teach, and reflect on all stages of a receptive skills lesson (Either listening or reading.)\r\n-) Plan, teach, and reflect on all stages of a lesson in terms of cultural impact on the learners.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the course, I was accepted into the first of year of a program initiated by the President of Costa Rica to help improve English teaching instruction in high schools, where I was assigned to partner with a Costa Rican English teacher for a year. Afterwards, I moved to Colombia and taught Business English to professionals (ages 25-50) both privately and through a university, utilizing my Business degree from the University of Michigan.  I have also taught English to teenagers (ages 13-19) at several private language institutes.   At this point in time,  I speak Spanish fluently after living in Colombia for over five years and ten years total in Spanish speaking countries.  In addition, I have received years of formal training prior to Peace Corps, both in high school and college.  Recently, I successfully completed a course in teaching Spanish to foreigners at the University of Antioquia.  The course spanned four months and 160 hours, covering:\r\n\r\n-) The brain and how it relates to language learning.\r\n-) Spanish language morphology and syntax.\r\n-) Frequent grammar mistakes in Spanish.\r\n-) Strategies for teaching Spanish to foreigners.\r\n\r\nNow, I have moved back to New Jersey.\r\n\r\nI feel that my passion for language learning, patience, lesson planning skills, and ability to reflect on a class make me a great tutor. I communicate well with my students and tailor the classes to meet their specific needs.  Also, I can relate to my students because I have gone through the language learning process and understand their frustration.  I know the common problems that Spanish students face and am very effective in explaining concepts in a way that makes sense.  Not only will I be able to impart knowledge of the Spanish language, but also aspects of the culture since I have lived in several countries in Latin America.\r\n\r\nAfter figuring out the student's specific needs, I will design a class that is both demanding and interesting, but not overwhelming.  I assign challenging homework assignments in order to internalize new material, committing it to long-term memory; it will also serve as a diagnostic tool to determine areas of strength and weakness, ensuring that the student has a thorough understanding of the material before moving on.  Problem areas will be reviewed at the beginning of each class.\r\n\r\nI try to be flexible with time.  While I do have a 24-hour cancellation policy, I offer makeup classes.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you and helping you achieve success in your studies.  My experience ensures that you will make substantial improvements in your Spanish language skills very quickly.",

I believe that the path to fluency looks a little different for each individual, and I am willing to consider materials and strategies suggested by students and parents.\r\n\r\nI have experience tutoring peers in writing, and I have had the pleasure of helping my peers find success in all stages of the writing process. One of my favorite things about tutoring is witnessing the moment when a student realizes that they have the tools and knowledge that they need to complete the task at hand. \r\n\r\nIn addition to tutoring experience, I have also had the amazing opportunity to assist with English classes at a music conservatory in Granada, Spain. Having to explain English grammar, spelling, and syntax to native speakers helped me to improve my skills in using and teaching both languages.\r\n\r\nAs a result of ten years of hard work studying the Spanish language and the many cultures of the Spanish-speaking world, I have acquired fluency. During two trips to Mexico and a semester in Spain, I was able to communicate with locals with regards to everything from directions to politics to my own culture.\r\n\r\nI would love the opportunity to help students of all ages to improve their skills in English and/or Spanish! I believe that the most effective learning takes place when students are empowered to take control of their learning and are given the necessary support along the way to become successful learners.

Ever since I was a child, I have had a fascination with communication in another language since communication represents a fundamental part of the human experience. My deep-seated interest in knowing additional languages, combined with the teaching experiences I have had both at home (high school in Charlotte) and abroad (internship in Ecuador), allow me to create a learning environment where students feel highly motivated. The \"Outstanding Graduate\" awards I received as an undergraduate student attest to the fact that I strive for excellence, and I expect the same from my pupils.\r\n\r\nHaving just completed one year of teaching at the high school level, I know how to make Spanish relevant and interesting for my pupils. For example, I ask questions in Spanish about what one did over the weekend, and I include information about different aspects of culture. i.e. food and music, in my lessons. My license as a Spanish teacher applies to grades K-12, and I have a Master's degree in Spanish, so I would feel comfortable teaching students older or younger than high school age as well. Regardless of the level, however, I expect that any students I tutor are prepared for the sessions at all times, and that they put forth an honest effort to make the most of their time. Homework may or may not be assigned, but students must demonstrate that they are mastering the material, i.e. achieving at least an 80% on quizzes (and retaking any quizzes where the score is below an 80%).\r\n  \r\nI am very patient and sensitive to learners' different strengths and weaknesses. I enjoy taking the time necessary to make sure my students have met my learning objectives, since one must have a thorough understanding of one topic before moving on to another when it comes to language. Periodically, I assess understanding of the material by way of short, informal quizzes in which the four skills- listening, reading, writing, and speaking- are assessed. Although I do not place emphasis on any one skill over another, I believe that speaking in Spanish to my students, regardless of the level, makes them see the practical importance of the language. While I specialize in Spanish, I would feel comfortable tutoring ESL learners as well.\r\n\r\nI am willing to organize a free consultation meeting prior to tutoring sessions. I require a 24-hour notice of cancellation prior to any session, though I offer makeup sessions.\r\n\r\nI look forward to helping you succeed in your language studies!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

            "FreeResponse": "I am currently a student at the University of Rhode Island with a 3.94 GPA enrolled in my last year of a 5 year dual-degree program. I have chosen to pursue a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and a B.A in Spanish. Throughout my years as a student I have always immensely enjoyed Math and once I finished taking Math courses I knew I couldn't give it up so I decided to become a tutor. It has been extremely rewarding being able to help so many people and to see the look on their faces when the Math concepts start to click for them. I'm extremely passionate as a tutor not only because I love Math but because I love helping people. \r\n\r\nMy tutoring style stems from a technique called scaffolding, where I like to build up a student's base of knowledge and confidence by teaching them the concepts in a simplified and easy-to-understand manner and then slowly easing off and letting the student find their own way through the material. I find that it is usually most beneficial as a tutor to be a peer rather than to be a teacher, and because of that I do my best to make students comfortable during my sessions. I like to use lots of visuals and white board drawings to aid in the understanding of complex concepts and to simplify things down to a more understandable level. I like to leave students with plenty of time to ask questions and to work on their own as well while I gently guide them in the right direction. Of course, I am very flexible and know how to change my tutoring style based on how I see a student progressing.\r\n\r\nI have 3 years of tutoring experience working as a tutor hired by the University of Rhode Island. During my time as a tutor, I have worked in a walk-in center where students of all different levels of math come in to receive help. For each of the 6 semesters I have tutored, I attend a pre-service training where I am trained on the best tutoring practices by the university and given feedback on my personal growth as a tutor. I feel I have benefited greatly from being able to work alongside other tutors and observe their tutoring practices while simultaneously being trained and observed myself. In addition to the walk-in center tutoring where I have tutored from pre-algebra all the way to Calculus 3, I have scheduled private one-on-one sessions with students who feel they need extra help outside the walk-in center.  I feel that my experience tutoring for the University of Rhode Island has provided me with a wealth of knowledge that I would like to pass on to others through my tutoring practices.\r\n\r\nI encourage parents or students to reach out with any doubts or questions and I will be sure to provide a quick response. I hope to see you soon in a personalized tutoring session!",

I started tutoring since I was in third year in college, my dad (who's also a physicist) worked as a teacher for 40 years so I guess I inherited his passion for teaching. The first student I had, a middle school student, who used to fail math every year, and then his mom contacted me and we started working together, by the end of the year he was one of the best students of his class and now he has a degree in marketing and is a very successful professional. Once he told me that the most important thing he learned by working together with me was to trust his capacity and never doubt of his intelligence and that's what I try to teach to my students, that they are capable of achieve their goals but we must work hard to get them.\n\nSince that first student I have had a lot more than I can remember, I have also taught at college level the subjects of mathematics, physics and astronomy. Back in my country (I'm from El Salvador) we have a gifted kids program, I worked in that program teaching modern physics, general physics and electromagnetism. Because of my work in that program I was awarded with a Fulbright scholarship to attend WSU, where I used to tutor athletes and as a teaching assistant of the astronomy class.\n\nIf you need help to improve your knowledge in math and science, don't hesitate in contact me, it will be my pleasure to work with you. I have time flexibility just contact me and we can settle the best schedule for you.",

            "FreeResponse": "Hey there, my name's Mike and I'm excited about the opportunity to put my 10+ years of teaching and tutoring experience to work for you!  I've taught preschool age children to read and write, seniors looking to pick up a foreign language or some martial arts training, and every age and subject in between.  When it comes down to it, I just really love learning new things and I'm passionate about sharing that knowledge with others.  I believe that, with the proper guidance and the right amount of effort, everyone has the ability to learn anything.\r\n\r\nIn my personal academic career, I excelled in the many IB and AP classes I took at a top-tier high school.  Coupled with my perfect SAT Math score and an eloquent college essay, I was admitted into the UIllinois Mechanical Engineering program, then ranked #4 in the country.  There, I received the International Engineering Scholarship and I served as President of a hands-on problem-solving student organization, Project Q.  While at U of I, I decided to use the opportunity to pursue some of my other interests and ultimately graduated with a B.A. in Religion with a 4.0 major GPA.\r\n\r\nSince graduating, I've held full-time positions in post-secondary certificate programs, urban elementary schools, and suburban high schools.  I recently finished up a two-year administrative position in the New Orleans area, helping a school complete their recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina.  I currently teach Honors Chemistry part-time at the high school level.\r\n\r\nAs for tutoring, I got my start while still in secondary school, finding that classmates turned to me when they needed extra help, particularly with math and science coursework.  Throughout my entire undergraduate career, I tutored an elementary student with special needs, meeting once or twice a week for nearly five years, developing his language skills in English and Hebrew.  I used that experience to go to work part-time for a tutoring and test prep company in the NW Suburbs after graduating.  During that time, I tutored high school students both individually and in group settings in ACT, SAT, math, English, science, public speaking, and writing.\r\n\r\nI suppose that what makes my tutoring and teaching unique is that I guide my students along the way.  Instead of solving that practice ACT Math problem for you while you watch, I ask you questions and give you hints so you can come to the right answer on your own.  And rather than pushing you to do that English assignment you don't understand, I explain and show you why that comma makes a big difference in the sentence you wrote - \"let's eat Grandma\" or \"let's eat, Grandma.\"\r\n\r\nIf you hadn't noticed yet, tutoring is fun for me.  But more importantly, I find it really rewarding to see students equally as excited about learning.  My proudest moments as a tutor have always been seeing students accomplish what they thought they never could.  So, whether you want a to score a bit higher on your midterm, or you need a miracle to not fail that final, I'm your guy.\r\n\r\nNow, how may I help you today?",

The structure of Spanish is a little bit different to English but not too much. \r\n\r\nMy approach to teach is to know first what level you have in knowledge and later I make a construction of new things over this level. \r\n\r\nI can teach individuals, groups, kids and adults.

I'm that good! ;)\r\n\r\nWhile working on my doctorate at CCCLA, I informally taught students a specialty technique within the profession for three years. From July 2001 to April 2017 I spent countless hours in communities teaching individuals and groups about health. In 2011 I produced four, forty-five minute powerpoint presentations from my own knowledge and research on Nutrition, Exercise, Emotional and Neurological Wellness respectively and have shared my knowledge with many support groups, community groups and patients since 2007. \r\n\r\nI am an outstanding Anatomy and Physiology tutor because I have a doctorate level education of these subjects and ten years hands on working experience of their application. I'm very passionate about both these subjects because they are the foundation of health.\r\n\r\nMy specialty in Spanish is grammar, which most students struggle with. Because I love it, I'm more patient than most tutors and because I have lived in and/or visited Costa Rica, Mexico and Colombia, I can give you a cultural perspective on the language as well.\r\n\r\nFitness has long been a passion of mine and when I finished my doctorate I added nutrition to the list. I have or have access to a wealth of knowledge on these subjects. So whatever your goal may be, I am well qualified to help you achieve it.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me to learn more and schedule a lesson!",

I received a double degree in music (vocal performance) and environmental policy and management, with a minor in spatial studies. \r\n\r\nBecause I completed two degree programs I have taken a wide variety of college courses, from music theory 4 to calculus to ecology. As a student, I was employed by the university as a tutor for music theory, ear training, spatial studies, and math. I have also tutored students to prepare them for the SAT and the GRE.\r\n\r\nI love tutoring because it allows me to work directly with a student and help them succeed. My tutoring style is unique because I take advantage of a wide range of resources so that each student receives a diverse education. I am constantly testing out new tutoring methods, so I can find the technique that works best for each of my students. This ensures that each student has a positive and worthwhile learning experience.\r\n\r\nFor the longest time, math was a struggle for me too. In high school, I felt as though math teachers rushed through the material without fully explaining the concepts. This made the entire learning experience frustrating, especially since I really did want to understand. That all changed when I took calculus in college. My teacher explained the logic behind the math equations, and finally everything clicked! I received a 4.0 in the class, and have loved math ever since. I did extremely well in the math section of the GRE, and have tutored all math classes up to calculus. \r\n\r\nI think that my previous struggles with math make me a great tutor in this subject, because I truly understand how difficult it can be. With my in-depth knowledge, I am able to explain confusing concepts in a way that is logical and straightforward.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read through my profile and for considering me for your tutoring needs!

            "FreeResponse": "¡Hola! Me llamo Esther. I am a certified bilingual student at Grand Valley State University, and am enrolled in the Elementary Education program. I started off my college career pursuing Graphic Design, but I soon realized I was meant to be an educator. I switched degree paths and have never looked back. Last semester, I finished my Teacher Assisting, and will be Student Teaching this coming January.  I currently am a teacher at an Early Childhood Development Center, in a classroom with infants between the ages of 8-15 months. I love teaching, especially in my second language. Other than Spanish, teaching Language Arts in English is my greatest strength. I also am able to teach Science and Mathematics at the elementary level. \r\n\r\nI really love working with young children, but am very willing to work with any student, regardless of age. I have over five years of experience in tutoring elementary school students in a wide variety of subjects. My Teacher Assisting was completed in a kindergarten classroom, which was an amazing and fun experience. I focused on emergent reading and writing skills with my kindergartners, and was amazed at the skill level they were able to reach in a short amount of time. I also worked as a Reading Tutor in a summer reading program for Grand Rapids Public Schools, which included children in first through third grade. I have privately tutored nine different students, ranging in age from six years old to eleven. This presented the enjoyable challenge of providing very different supports for each individual child. When I was a teenager I assisted my mom in the homeschooling of my two younger brothers, with a focus on Language Arts, Geography, World History, and Science. In addition to these experiences, I've had many opportunities to tutor and work with children throughout my college career.\r\n\r\nAs a tutor, you can expect me to be very patient and kind. I am extremely dedicated to being a supportive, gentle, and perceptive teacher. I love helping students to find new ways of approaching problems or challenges, rather than just providing the solutions. I value effort and thoughtfulness rather than accuracy alone, because I believe we learn the most when we take risks and are willing to make mistakes. My main goal as an educator is to encourage and facilitate the growth of my students, and I believe in giving students appropriately difficult, yet attainable, learning goals. I'd love to hear from you if you think I am a good match for you and/or your child!\r\n",

I love tutoring because I strongly believe in the one-on-one instruction, and it is very satisfying to see how students become more confident with the language, and their progress is fast and evident.\r\n\r\nI have been teaching Spanish at a college and university level for over 10 years.\r\n\r\nI'm very familiar with the High School Spanish curriculum...and I know each student working with me will learn a great deal while having fun and enjoying the learning experience.",

I am currently an undergraduate research student in a biophysics lab work under a PhD recipient to analyzing fibrins in the body to see their mechanical properties and what those implications mean. I founded and currently run the Robotics Club on campus and have been successful in creating a start-up business for myself. With these abilities I can help your student and child not only in the subject, but beyond the subject in how they approach life and future academic challenges. I am knowledgeable in both the sciences and businesses as my majors transcend both areas and have many crossovers, which allows me to have experience with math and analysis beyond just a laboratory or math approach, and more to an overall problem solving approach. \r\n\r\nI have helped many of my fellow peers in their classes among all spectrum, be it chemistry and physics all the way to accounting and economics. This helping nature spurred me to become a tutor, and I am currently in the works of becoming a tutor at the university where I will be able to help more students. When tutoring I first like to highlight the problem at hand as sometimes a student in math doesn't understand a concept because they have missed an important stepping stone for the next topic and when that is highlighted it sometimes helps them progress. I also have a lot of patience and willingness to help, as being a student myself, there are times when I don't understand something at first and from this I can see where frustration occurs. Since I can relate and understand these struggles as a peer and as a student, it makes it easier to understand and be patient to help a student. \r\n",

I have worked primarily with students tutoring in Spanish and English from ages 6-18 years of age. I create engaging lesson plans tailored to what the student and parents think should be covered. I also strive to make languages and grammar fun and memorable to aid in the learning process through speaking, writing, video, audio and other types of assignments.\n\nI am a graduate ('07) from NYU Stern School of Business and currently a freelance strategy consultant in Chicago. When I took the SAT in 2002, I received a SAT score of 1440 out of a possible 1600.  700 in Math and 740 in Verbal.  \n\nIn high school, I was part of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program and took several Advanced Placement (AP) classes, including Calculus, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, English, US History, Spanish, and French.  I scored a 5 out of 5 in both Economics courses, English and in Spanish.  \n\nIn 2010, I spent a year abroad teaching English in Spain. As a result of living abroad and minoring in Spanish Language at NYU and studying abroad in Madrid, I am fluent in Spanish language and have a mastery of the grammar.  I enjoy teaching language and picked up a lot of teaching experience and techniques when I taught English in Spain alongside professional teachers.  \n\nWith almost two years of experience tutoring Spanish children and adults in the English language, I understand how to create an effective lesson plan, understand the common points of confusion between the two languages, and because I am a native English speaker and fluent in Spanish, I understand the nuances of both languages.  \n\nIn my work as a management consultant and in my college years at Stern, I am often surrounded by others very smart in math but lacking in verbal and written communication skills.  As a result, I often end up doing all of the proofreading and editing for others which keeps my skills sharp.",

After seeing her success, I was motivated to tutor others in different subjects and have been doing it ever since.  I have experience with people of all ages and backgrounds.

My personal journey with being a student has been a long one, and during that time I have realized that having a tutor or teacher that makes learning fun and enjoyable is crucial to mastering the subject. That is why I strive to make learning fun and enjoyable. I like to introduce concepts in a fun and entertaining way at first and then dive in to the material, while allowing the student to practice the material on their own. This method can and will be adjusted to the student's individual needs.  \n\nI have tutored ESL/English/Writing for 2+ years.

I have tutored many people who wanted to learn the language and have been very successful. I believe that in this day and age, people should strive to learn different languages. Spanish, I have found, is in high demand for potential jobs and overall is a great language to know. I can absolutely help you with this subject!\n\nAs of May 2017 I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Criminal Justice from Sam Houston State University.

I feel engaged and committed to students success, and I love seeing them more empowered and confident in their studies.\r\n\r\nMy Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences and PhD in Cell Biology give a a very good background to teach any Biology subject. I am very good at it, because I really like all these subjects and feel passionate about them.\r\n\r\nI feel passionate about teaching any subject from elementary school, because I taught most of the subjects in the past, and I love the students feedback when they see the connection of different subjects. For them are very special years, full of discovering many important and basic facts that makes them feel very engaged in learning.  \r\n\r\nI am always happy to see students succeed at any level, and share their enthusiasm.

            "FreeResponse": "Howdy, I'm Trevor! I graduated from King's Fork High School in the Class of 2017 in June of this year and I'm currently enrolled at Bridgewater College as an undergraduate student. I have always had an interest in learning new things, as well as helping others learn them. I enjoy meeting new people and finding out what common interests we share.\n\nAs a \"Mathe-Magician\", I loved doing mathematics in high school and I also took an interest in U.S. history and government. I passed Pre-Algebra and Algebra I with straight A's and developed a solid understanding of the material. I have experience tutoring my cousin, who has a learning disability, in Algebra I. I guided him through the material and double-checked his work to make sure he understood the material fully and, within six weeks, he went from a D to a B- in Algebra I.\n\nAs stated before, I have always loved math. I have an excellent understanding of Arithmetic, Pre-Algebra, and Algebra I, so mathematics is my strong suit. Not only did I tutor my cousin, I also helped students at an alternative school who had trouble with math. I exercised creativity in my tutoring techniques so as to keep their attention and teachers noticed major improvements in their understanding of the material.\n\nI have an ever increasing interest in American politics and government. I find I can relate to the material very well and I took government in high school at the AP level. I have a detailed understanding of the Constitution and all of its 27 Amendments, as well as the separation of powers and the intent of the Framers for forming a bicameral legislature.\n\nI am a very friendly and outgoing person, so I love meeting new people. I'm here to help you, so feel free to contact me and I will give you a response within 24 hours. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me!",

Providing assistance for people who need it is what I will continue to do throughout my life. I know how important it is to succeed in education and I want to give the proper skills to my students to where eventually they can succeed independently. I will provide lesson plans that will make learning easy and fun, as well as provide reinforcement that is motivating to the students. At the end of the lesson plans, I will let the students practice the material on their own and go over it with them to catch any remaining problems the students are having. I am very flexible and will adjust my methods according to what is best for individual students because, after all, everyone learns differently. \r\n\r\nI have 4 months experience as an elementary and intermediate Spanish tutor. I helped college students with their conversation skills, test preparation, and online homework. I had many students that needed help with many different elements in Spanish, whether it was verb conjugations or sentence structure. I was prepared to help each student with everything they needed and provided lesson plans to the students that helped the session run smoothly. I am getting close to a year of working with children with autism as well as ADHD. I provide ABA therapy for my clients and teach them motor skills, verbal imitations, and tacting skills. I understand how to properly reinforce and continually motivate children with autism and ADHD.

Feel free to contact me with any questions or to schedule a lesson!\r\n\r\nMath is a hobby of mine. I love the complexity of numbers and problem-solving. Teaching children something that I love will be easy and effortless for me and the children. I know math can be a challenging subject to learn, especially the elementary math, but with some tutoring from me I know I can help students succeed. Where I have experience working with children, I will maintain a high energy level a motivation throughout the entire session. I want to provide children with specific math skills in order to grow and have success in their future math courses.\r\n\r\nI was a Spanish minor in college and traveled to Santiago, Chile to practice my conversation skills in Spanish. I have always loved the language and have continued to practice the language for six years. I can tutor beginner Spanish and intermediate Spanish, as I am not fluent in the language yet. I am working towards the goal of becoming a fluent Spanish speaker, but as of now I can help you with the beginning of learning the language and we will go from there. I want to help you learn a new language because of the growing diversity all around us. Knowing another language is considered a great quality and I want to help you begin those steps of learning Spanish!\r\n\r\nI have a full-time job working as a Behavior coach for children with autism and ADHD. I provide ABA therapy and have learned the skills to help these children learn and grow as an independent individual. I will get a good grasp on the individual student and their specific needs for tutoring. I have an abundance of patience and know I can work with these specific special needs individuals with anything they need. I will provide constant reinforcement and use terminology that will help the individuals succeed, even if they are little victories. I will strive for success for these individuals and would love to help!\r\n\r\nIf you want an enthusiastic and hard-working tutor, please contact me!

My name is Joanne B. and my students call me \"Mrs. B.\"  I am a full-time middle school ESL teacher and a mommy of 2 small and very energetic children! I was born in Lima, Peru, so English was not my first language. I learned English through the Direct Method, which is learning a new language using only the target language, which was English. I now work with students using the Direct Method as a combination with the Grammar-Translation Method, which uses the person's native language to assist in learning the target language. How much of each method I use depends on my learners, which I can differentiate and accommodate with each of my individual students. I have taught students from ages 3 through 15, all with different levels of language skills.\n\nI wish to pass down to my students the feeling of wanting to learn in order to succeed and overcome barriers and obstacles that may come their way in their learning and mastering a new language.\n\nTo be an outstanding tutor, one needs to be patient, flexible, kind and sympathetic.  Not every student is alike, so a tutor needs to be able to change lesson plans according to their students' needs and struggles.  As a teacher, I have students of many levels in one class, and I have managed to remain flexible to my students' needs, so as a Tutor, I am able to have just that much more focus on my student in order for them to succeed that much faster.\n\nI live in Egg Harbor Township, but travel all the way near Cherry Hill for work, so distance is not much of an issue.  I also have Skype and can be reached online for online learning if that is what you wish!  Call me, text me, or e-mail me to schedule a time and day that is good for you!  \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\nAll the best,\nMrs. B",

I recently spent 9 months living in Extremadura, Spain teaching English to native-Spanish speakers. I decided to do this so I could immerse myself in the Spanish language and experience the trials and tribulations of travel. I have taken countless Spanish classes based on grammar, conversation, literature, medical interpretation, and general beginner Spanish. I know how to take a Spanish class.\n\nWhen it comes to teaching English, I have a TEFL 200 Certification from Florida State University's Center for Intensive English Studies. That program consisted of three months of intense lesson preparation, conversation partners, class observation, syllabus construction, and English tutoring. I also spent 9 months working at various public schools and private schools as a lead and assistant teacher for bilingual programs, teaching the English language.\n\nI recently worked at a local private school as a teaching assistant and an after-care supervisor. Teaching and tutoring have become my passion since graduating and I would be happy to assist anyone who needs my help.\n\nAs a native English speaker and a TEFL 200 certification holder, I know the nuances of the English language as well as the grammatical formulas necessary to speak English communicatively.\n\nAs far as ACT prep, I have experience in the formulaic way that the ACT is set up and can help students prepare themselves to be effective test takers.\n\nI've been studying Spanish for 8 years and have spent 4 months immersed in the Spanish language in South America as well as 9 months in Spain. I know what textbooks do teach and I know what they should teach. When it comes to grades, I know what teachers test for and what is expected of a Spanish language student both in beginner and advanced classes.\n\nPlease feel free to send me a message so we can get started on improving our Spanish and English fluency.",

In my time as a tutor, I have seen my students flourish as their understanding of a subject grows and they are able to apply their skills to a task. I also understand that not everyone learns the same way. This has prompted me to be able to be adaptable to the needs of my students while also accomplishing a goal, be that getting an A on a test, passing a class, or getting a greater understanding of the material presented.\n\nI specialize in Math, Anatomy & Physiology, Spanish, and English. These were my favorite subjects in school and I prided myself in doing the best that I possibly could in each one.\n\nAs a recent graduate of Emory University, I also know that hard work and dedication pays off. While in school, I held myself to a high standard of work and I expect my students to do the same. I assign challenging and fun assignments that will allow the student to apply what they learn in different ways without overwhelming them. I have found that this reinforces the things they have learned.\n\nMath is all about understanding the basics and applying them. I love the logical order of Algebra. I always came top of my class when tests were given. I have been a math tutor for 2.5 years and enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nAs a ARRT registered X-ray and MRI technologist, graduating with my BMSc in Diagnostic Medical Imaging, I have been trained to recognize anatomical structures and know their functions. I can use my clinical experiences to provide practical applications to students who are having trouble with Anatomy and Physiology.\n\nI have been a fluent Spanish speaker for 7 years. It is a beautiful language, both in its structure and simplicity. I have been a Spanish tutor for about 4 years, helping each of my students to increase their understanding and embrace this wonderful language.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and helping you on your journey to achieve success and reach your dreams.",

            "FreeResponse": "I have extensive experience in both tutoring and teaching. My most recent professional teaching experience involved teaching Spanish for three years in the Mississippi Delta to elementary school students in grades pre kindergarten through fourth. During that time, I also tutored and provided homework assistance to high school students in courses including English Language Arts and Spanish. \r\n\r\nWhile pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Spanish and Social Welfare and Justice, I tutored Spanish-speaking adults in English as a Second Language, computer and citizenship courses through several community organizations in Milwaukee. These tutoring experiences involved one-on-one and group sessions designed to meet students' individual goals. \r\n\r\nI am currently certified to teach elementary education to students in grades four through six and Spanish education to students in grades Kindergarten through twelve. \r\n\r\nI studied and majored in Spanish in college, during which time I tutored Spanish-speaking adults in ESL, computer and citizenship courses. I also have experience tutoring adult students in GED course content. \r\n\r\nI am extremely detail-oriented, and very much enjoy proofreading and providing constructive feedback on essays, papers, and other writing samples. \r\n\r\nI majored in Spanish in college, and taught Spanish to elementary school students for three years. Having extensively studied the language and taught speaking, reading, writing and listening proficiency to elementary school students, I am extremely passionate for the Spanish language, and welcome any opportunities to assist others in growing their understanding and passion for the language. \r\n\r\nI hope you will consider allowing me to help support your tutoring needs! Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information or to schedule a tutoring session. ",

I had taught French at Berlitz for five years to children, teenagers, and adults, people who were brand new to the language and some who learned some either in high school or in college. Some students wanted to prepare for a trip, get better at work or at home with family members, still other wanted to get better grades and came for punctual tutoring, but most students usually want to learn how to speak French fluently.\n\nI am a native speaker and when I wanted to waive my modern language requirements during my undergraduate years, I received a perfect score on my french CLEP exam: 80/80. \n\nBesides French, there are more subjects I am happy to offer my help with.

            "FreeResponse": "I have been a student of Spanish for the last 16 years and have been lucky enough to experience a variety of learning environments. My Spanish journey began with a k-5 immersion program. I continued learning in a traditional classroom environment throughout high school and into university. \r\n\r\nLast summer I lived abroad in León, Spain as a student of the language and culture. While there I worked for an organization called the Fundación de Familias Monoparentales Isadora Ducan where I developed educational activities for and worked with children ages 5-12. We wrote acrostic poems, built models of constellations, worked with a 3D printer and much more. \r\n\r\nAt this same organization I was part of a conversational english program for students ages 12-17. We met four times a week and discussed a different issue at each meeting. We talked about teenagers and social media, the environment, differences between Spain and the United States, and everything else under the sun! Their confidence with speaking english grew each day and by the end of the summer conversation flowed quite naturally. \r\n\r\nFor the past year I have been tutoring high school and university students. My work with university students involves assisting with the editing of papers and presentations, discussing study strategies, imparting tips and tricks for retaining concepts, discussing students' educational goals and practicing conversational skills. I meet weekly with other Spanish tutors and the chair of the Spanish department to discuss our experience as tutors, what it means to be a tutor and to clarify specific grammatical concepts. \r\n\r\nMy work with high school students is much more independent and has allowed me to design programs of study for individual students based on their interests and educational goals. I meet twice weekly with one student and once a week with a pair of students. We discuss their progress in class and their concerns, go over homework, prepare for tests, play games, and practice conversational skills. Through independent tutoring I have become driven to help students learn and fall in love with Spanish using their own passions. I work with a student who wants to become a professional snowboarder and loves to mountain bike. Last week we read an article about why people should try snowboarding and then I had him tell me about his most recent adventure. We drew his favorite ski resort and the parts of a snowboard. Learning a language by learning about what you love is such an exciting and motivating strategy. I am in the process of developing  a lesson about mountain biking as well.\r\n\r\nSix months ago I began working as a Spanish teacher in a 6 & 7 grade classroom. My co teacher and I taught twice weekly in the mornings and met weekly to develop lessons and plan the semester. We put on a fashion show, sang songs, made hot chocolate, wrote poems and played a lot of games! We also had pen pals from an English class taught by an old classmate of mine in southern Spain. Having pen pals was really exciting for everyone and contextualized the language learning experience.\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed working as a translator for the past year as well. I recently finished translating a gallery book on a exhibition of African Masks and am now working on translating web pages for the Klamath Connection program at Humboldt State University.\r\n\r\nLearning Spanish has been my passion for a long time but my appreciation for the language has grown exponentially since I began tutoring and teaching. I love tutoring because it really allows me to work deeply with a client to discover the way they want to learn, what excites them and where their passions lie.  Learning a language can seem daunting but with a little help it can rock your world! I look forward to helping you achieve your educational goals, whatever they may be! I'm excited to meet interested parties. Please contact me soon to begin.",

            "FreeResponse": "My name is Luis. I graduated from The University of Chicago with honors and on the Dean's List - a school where I received a well-rounded comprehensive education that was a stellar fit for my own curiosity and pursuit of knowledge. \r\n\r\nUpon graduating from UChicago, I was  published at The University of Chicago Press and since then have published other works of mine, including political essays and music that I've composed and created on a DAW (digital audio workstation), the latter being released for both  commercial purposes and recently, Wikipedia. But what does my success have to do with you? Well, the tutoring, mentoring, and teaching I've been doing since around the age of 13 has been instrumental in facilitating all these accomplishments, as I've guided youth and elders alike along various walks of life ever since, and in this way have augmented my own understanding of the processes that lead to one being a successful student of life. More so, my masters degree in teaching from National Louis University has only widened and enhanced my understanding of how one can auspiciously develop. And as a yoga practitioner of 10 years, practicing in various Chicago studios at first and now on a daily home practice, and student of ancient spiritual texts, I integrate mindfulness in my approach to learning and teaching a subject.  So bottom line, you, the student will be benefiting from my own personal success and growth that hinged on the quality learning I received and continue to receive as a life-long learner.\r\n\r\nWhere I have taught and tutored includes teaching catechism to youth at the age of 13; leading an after school program at 18 for at-risk youth; \r\nproviding introductory computer classes to adults in both English-only and bilingual (Spanish and English language) settings; and most recently in life, having no less than 5 years of classroom teaching experience with high school students where I taught both Spanish I and Spanish II level courses utilizing a personally crafted curriculum to suit the needs of the student. It was also in this last setting where I started and led an after school yoga program for some of my students. Today, I'm happy to say that most of them continue their practice without me at their side. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to direct any further questions to me. And whether or not we do meet, I do wish you the best.  Namaste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Some of these classes include: college algebra, precalculus, calculus I-III, differential equations, linear algebra, and statistics. I also have a year of experience as a recitation instructor for the lower-level undergraduate courses we offer at UNT. In particular, I have taught recitation classes for college algebra, survey of mathematics, and an algebra review recitation for a probability and statistics course. In these classes I prepared lectures, held test review sessions, and answered any questions the students had with regards to their assignments. \r\n\r\nI mostly have experience with helping college students, but I am more than happy to answer any math-related questions from anyone. My tutoring approach consists of asking the students what problems they want to go over, talking them through the problem step by step, and checking their understanding after the problems have been discussed. The most important part for me as a tutor is to make sure the student is able to solve the problems on their own because this means they understand the concepts and are ready for the upcoming material.",

I am patient with all my students and am especially determined to see matters through to completion.

I am certified to teach secondary mathematics and K-12 Spanish, but I also am an experienced tutor in several other subjects, including reading, SAT prep, and ACT prep. I am familiar with the Common Core State Standards, having worked with them extensively as a teacher and a tutor. I studied Spanish for 5 years, including one semester abroad in Chile. I am familiar with both the ACT and the SAT, performing well on both. I received a 32 out of a possible 36 on the ACT, and a 2240 out of a possible 2400 (or 1490 out of 1600) on the SAT. I was named a National Merit and National Achievement Scholar for my high performance on the PSAT. When I am helping or tutoring someone, my goal is not just to give them the answers to their questions. I prefer to guide them so that we can find the answer together and more importantly, so that they will be able to repeat the process on their own once the tutoring session has been completed.

However, at that time, I had already returned to Spain to teach and live. I taught English to 7th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders at a Jesuit school. I was responsible for 25 hours of class a week. While I taught a wide range of levels, I worked with every student on speaking, pronunciation, listening, and occasional writing. Aside from the students, I also helped the English teachers prepare for level-assessment exams.\n\nI was a student for many years and was fortunate to have had many dedicated, caring, and passionate teachers along the way. They, whether it was in Elementary School or College, did whatever they could to help me and my classmates get better. And they always made sure to show us how much they loved what they taught. My promise to you is the same: I will my share my passion for these subjects and do whatever it takes to help you improve. And in return, I ask for the same from the students: that they come with questions, with doubts, and above all else, with a desire to get better.\n\nThank you for your interest.

            "FreeResponse": "I graduated in Colombia and moved to the United States in 2012. This country has given me extraordinary opportunities, one of them is to be a Spanish High School teacher. I have taught Spanish since my second year here. In the school I work at, the students age goes from 14 to 18 years old. I have been working with groups of 10 students in average and even though the relationship between students and teachers is very respectful, it is also pretty close. I give them class every week day, but also tutor on the side students who might need extra assistance one on one.\r\n\r\nI have also experience tutoring young adults who are interested in becoming fluent in Spanish. I have experience teaching an tutoring Intro, Intermediate and Advanced Spanish. I plan my classes and tutoring sessions keeping in mind the goals of my students. However, my teaching style always require a huge participation on the student side. I introduce the material in an inductive way, asking questions and having the student discover the right use to the tenses and vocabulary that will be reinforced with practice (reading, speaking, listening and writing). At the end of the lesson they are able to produce sentences in speaking and writing in the target language using the material that was covered.\r\n\r\nIn the world we live in today, I consider that it is really important to learn another language, not only to expand your mind, but also to explore how other people think. It helps us becoming more considerate, tolerant and respectful. \r\n\r\nI want to support my students the best way I can. I am very open to suggestions and feedback from students and parents. Feel free to contact me with additional questions or to schedule a lesson. I provide quick responses and I am excited to help more language student to achieve their goals.",

            "FreeResponse": "I have over 20 years of tutoring experience in Spanish, English, French and Creative writing in College and at a tutoring center in Stamford, CT.  I am a published author, poet, singer-songwriter and experienced editor, so I not only teach these skills, I'm also constantly honing and sharpening my skills as part of my craft.  I'm also passionate about the work I do and my biggest reward is to create light bulb moments for all my students, as they enjoy the learning process.  I also customize the lessons to what my students' needs are.  \r\n\r\nI've been a French and Spanish tutor since College, so 21 years now.  I minored in French in College and Spanish is my first language, as I was born and raised in Dominican Republic.  I went to the Licée Français of Santo Domingo from Kindergarten to 6th grade, and grew up speaking English, Spanish and French at home. I am also a writer and singer-songwriter, so I constantly work on my writing skills as part of my craft in both Spanish and French.  I also worked for Verizon communications managing international rates for French-speaking Africa, Europe and the Caribbean, so I applied my language skills to conduct business in these different regions.\r\n\r\nI am an author. I am known as the voice trainer, as I specialize in showing public speakers, serious actors and heart-centered entrepreneurs how to find their voice, save it from strain, so they can speak with ease, radiate more confidence and evoke real emotion with every conversation.  I also work with youth to develop their public speaking skills.  I've been a writer since I was 8 years old, writing children stories.  I worked as a journalist at The Westchester Business Journal, and I was a copywriter/proofreader at Reader's Digest.  \r\n\r\nI am a published songwriter with a repertoire of over 150 songs.  I have published songs with The Punisher Video Game, Bad Boy Latino, R.Evolución Latina and am currently licensing songs for different transformational workshops.  I am also composing my own Musical Comedy for Broadway, \"As The Oil Spills...\"  I am also an audio producer, specializing in producing voice over demos for my voice acting clients.\r\n\r\nYou have a challenge, you have my ears.  I work with you to find out exactly where your obstacles reside so we can overcome those obstacles.  I am patient, creative and I am willing to do what it takes to help you achieve your academic goals.  And hey, why not enjoy the process while we're at it?  Yes, it's serious work, but I'm a big believer in making the process an enjoyable experience.  I look forward to taking on your challenge and helping you achieve academic success.",

            "FreeResponse": "I'm Nikolai! I graduated cum laude with a degree in Dance and Choreography and I am a professional dance artist in Philadelphia. Dance and the many subjects associated with it have broadened my world in so many ways and I love incorporating concepts I've learned through the study of movement into tutoring more traditional school subjects. I began teaching myself Arabic, Portuguese, Greek, and Hindi through music, media, native speakers, and books. This study deepened my appreciation for my native language, English, and helped me broaden my cultural horizons. I am currently working on my own teaching syllabus that aims to understand the power that movement has on the way people learn in schools, especially how students acquire language competence and math skills. \r\n\r\nI have taught ESL to professional-age adults from around the world, namely Russia, China, Brazil, and Latin America. This was done through an online platform but I have also worked with school-age students in their ESL classes. I have also taught at a magnet performing arts high school as a technique teacher, teaching contemporary dance technique as well as improvisational strategies and creative movement. Currently, I work one-on-one with students with special needs in all of their core subjects: Math, English, Science, and Social Studies as well as behavioral and emotional support.\r\n\r\nI've grown up speaking Spanish and have always thought of it as a part of my life although I am not a native speaker. I grew up in Miami where Spanish is required from kindergarten so the language as well as Latinx culture have always been a fixture in my education. From my love of Spanish, I progressed to Greek and then Arabic and Portuguese, in order, at first, to understand the roots of Spanish. This curiousity led to a love for languages and their systems of evolution and their applications today. I believe that acquiring any language is healthy, brain-positive, and quite honestly, a civic and human duty so as to build trust and understanding between cultures. \r\n\r\nI have a certification to teach ESL which I acquired while teaching online. I have also been tutoring in formally in English for over a decade, editing papers, winning and helping others to win national writing competitions -namely the NCTE National Competition- tutoring friends and neighbors and siblings, and incorporating movement into the common core syllabus for non-native speakers. \r\n\r\nWell-roundedness and empathy are at the core of any good teacher and tutors skill set. Common Core allows these two traits to shine through in a person as the scope of the curriculum demands them. My broad experience profile coupled with years of teaching make for a great common core tutor.\r\n\r\nI have always been thirsty for knowledge about the world, its cultures and histories as well as the inner workings of our own country. Through media, travel, and personal experiences on a daily basis, I've cultivated an understanding of the worlds I move through on a deeply personal level. It's important that students not only understand their subject matter but that they intuit and feel both the subjects and their related topics.\r\n\r\nTutoring is more than drilling exercises or re-hashing what a student has been told they have to learn in school. What about the student's own learning style? What about things in the media of educational value that may help a student synthesize information? What about art and its power to bridge gaps in student comprehension? I ask myself these and more questions everyday when it comes to education and I hope to bring an understanding of broad concepts into a more concentrated relationship with students, bringing a seemingly vast world into a more compassionate, more tailor-made experience.",

            "FreeResponse": "My name is Sonja, I am from Austria and I am an English, German and Applied Ethics teacher. Shortly before I moved here to Sacramento in March this year I have graduated at my home University in Graz, Austria with a Master of Arts in English and American culture and wrote my master thesis in the field of Applied English Linguistics. My native language is German, I am fluent in English and Spanish and have basic communication knowledge in French and Arabic as well.\n\nBefore I started my studies in education to become a teacher I have worked in the fields of tourism, telecommunications and arts, but I found out that working as a teacher is the profession that fulfills me the most and that it is the one I would like to do for the rest of my life. I have been teaching and tutoring for over 7 years now. I communicate information and ideas clearly and efficiently and love to adapt to various learner styles. Throughout my time working as an ESL teacher, my objective has been to encourage critical thinking as I engage students to ask any question that is on their minds and so always put the learner in the center of any learning environment. My teaching style focuses on individualized instruction according to the specific needs of every individual student which is why I customize my teaching methods for every student to address various learning styles. \n\nI have studied the English language for more than 10 years and therefore know about the difficulties and obstacles learning a language entails. The fact that I have been through the process of learning English from scratch helps me to understand why certain students need extra help in certain areas of a language. My passion for English literature and culture makes it easy for me to inspire and encourage students to read, speak and write in English.\n\nAs a native speaker of German and trained German teacher I am aware of the complex nature of this language. Having taught students from age 10 to age 50 allows me to draw from an extensive pool of exercises and activities I have designed in the course of my studies and while working as an ESL teacher. I therefore can provide customized German lesson plans suitable for every age group and learner style. \n\nAs I have worked in the field of telecommunications for over 10 years and would describe myself as web savvy. This is why I combine traditional language instruction with innovative technology and allow my students to use their familiar social media tools. I have found that this lesson design encourages individual curiosity and discovery outside of the classroom. Therefore I believe that students working with me will encounter the perfect balance between having fun in learning by using tools they know and like, as for example apps and games on their smartphone to learn the language they need help in. I strongly believe that learning can also be fun- if the right methods are used - which is why the feedback I got from most of my students is that they found out that learning is not simply a chore but can also a rewarding and enjoyable activity. \nAs I work most of the time on my computer and I will respond to requests as soon as I receive them and will be happy to provide any additional information needed from side of the parents or students. I have a very flexible work schedule which is why I will also be available for tutoring sessions on very short notice. So, do not hesitate to contact me and schedule a tutoring lesson!",

Went over Financial Aid preparation, Microsoft office utilization and APA style writing. I always said \" A prepared students, is a confident student. A confident student, is a graduate!\".\n\nI am very passionate in helping others, I believe I have a gift of being an influential motivational and servant leader, and want to share my knowledge, best practices and education.  I have learned that in life you never stop learning, and everything you learn or experience is a step closer to what you want to achieve to be fulfilled.  I look forward to helping many people reach their full potential.",

Since 1998 I have tutored mostly college-aged students in English, Spanish, ESL and Humanities. Most of my students are US citizens but more than a few are international students who are just beginning to learn English.  I have been an Adjunct Instructor of those same subjects along with Creative Writing and Journalism for over 26 years, teaching mainly at the college level. I have tutored high school aged students in both Spanish and English also in the last decade. For several years in the '90s I taught Creative Writing workshops in high schools in different parts of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I love this work is seeing how my students succeed, sometimes in the face of great challenges. I earned a B.A. in Spanish at Millersville University of Pennsylvania and an M.S. in Journalism at Columbia University School of Journalism.\r\n\r\nI have helped thousands of students learn how to write well, in both academic and journalistic styles. I think my background as a tutor, teacher and writer has helped me understand the issues that many students face when trying to understand English grammar and composition. While most of my students are middle-class and of European backgrounds, more than a few of them have been students of color along with young people from other countries. Working successfully with this wide variety of people has made me a much better tutor and human being.\r\n\r\nI have a B.A. in Spanish. I have taught and tutored Elementary Spanish for over 25 years to a wide variety of students. This wide experience has helped me understand how to help students navigate the differences between Spanish and English. I have the added advantage of having grown up in a bilingual household, as I am half Puerto Rican. Along the way I have also worked as a translator and interpreter for public and private agencies which gives me a good perspective on how the language is spoken by people from several Latin American cultures. I am able to share this knowledge with my students.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that I am a people person. One of the many enjoyable aspects of this work is getting the chance to meet so many different students. Please let me know how I can help you.",

We must look at learning as a process that takes practice and hard work.  Some subjects may not be easy but with dedication, we can improve.  \r\n\r\nAs a tutor, I will consult with my students to discover what they are not confidant with and what is most important for them to learn.  Based on this, we can create lessons that target those skills that are lacking.  \r\n\r\nI have taught English as a Second Language for two years to children in grades K-8. This includes language development (learning vocabulary, phrases, etc.) and reading intervention (working with decoding and comprehension).   I also have one year of experience working with adult learners of English.  I can tailor my lessons based on student's needs.  \r\n\r\nI have a degree in Spanish and a certificate in Latin American Studies from the University of Cincinnati. I also have a lot of experience working with the Hispanic community.  These experiences along with my love of teaching will help me in forming lessons that fit my students needs.\r\n\r\nI am typically available Monday-Friday 4pm-9pm and Saturday 1pm-9pm.  I charge $50 per hour and can travel to meet students at coffee shops and/or restaurants.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me to schedule an appointment. I look forward to hearing from you!",

My adventures began in books but have been transformed into an insatiable desire to see the world and experience as many cultures and languages as possible.\r\nAs a high school student I lived and studied for one year in the beautiful country of Costa Rica. Although I had studied French for one semester before this opportunity, it was this experience which has driven my career as an educator. After graduating with a degree in Education certified to teach Spanish and teaching Spanish at the high school level I enthusiastically accepted a position to teach in an elementary level immersion program. This forward thinking program inspired me to pursue a Master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction. My desire has always been to create learning opportunities based on my knowledge of my student and solid educational research.\r\nI have worked with students as young as three as well as accomplished professionals. I have worked one on one and with classes as large as 40 students.  I am constantly searching for ways to reach each and every student – students who are academically challenged, unmotivated, in difficult circumstances or who have low self-confidence due to prior failure. I see myself as a most dedicated learning cheerleader who uses all of my expertise and resources to make the journey enjoyable and inspiring. If my students haven’t found success and a desire to continue learning, I haven’t accomplished my goal.\r\n\r\nI am am Spanish teacher who learned Spanish while living for one year with a Spanish speaking family. \r\n\r\nLearning Spanish should not seem like an impossible task. If you already speak one language there is absolutely no reason you cannot learn more. Let me show you how to study a different language and be successful.",

I have a BA in social communication from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, with academic and professional experience in marketing, social responsibility and community education. As a professional, I have had the valuable opportunity to interact with diverse people around the world, which has allowed me to develop skills to understand and adapt to their communication needs.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, this motivated me to expand my cultural horizons and embark on an adventure in the accompaniment and teaching of Spanish. Thus, I have had the happiness of being able to see the development of people who from German, Portuguese and French as mother tongue, have been able to more easily understand the language and learn a little more about Latin American culture.  \r\n\r\nMy background is based on the mentoring of high school and undergraduate students interested in a professional, clean and academic Spanish. I like that the sessions are not seen like classes but as small spaces and moments of learning Spanish as a life experience. In that sense, I have also experience working with adults who simply want to learn some Spanish in order to speak while traveling or young people who want to sing their favorite Latin song. Beyond grammar, vocabulary or pronunciation, with me you will learn how to use them in real contexts and even use your body expression to strengthen your communicative intention. In general, the tools to continue to learn this beautiful language throughout your life. As a native speaker and communicator, I have a neutral Spanish, which is important for a better understanding of the language.\r\n\r\nMy schedule is flexible. I have availability to have sessions during the day, at night or on weekends. Depending on the level you have and the pace of study you have, I can adapt the session to a conversational Spanish or beginner. In any case, you can be sure that we can be able to identify your strengths and points to improve in order to reach concrete and meaningful goals.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to strengthen your verbal skills or if you want to write academically, or even if you want to know a little more closely the Latin American culture, feel free to contact me and we will take a lesson.\r\n\r\nI hope we can be in touch soon.\r\n\r\n!Gracias y buen viento!",

I also taught advanced high school English. I volunteered my teaching expertise on weekends, teaching struggling middle/high school students at the Multicultural Family Education Support Center, and tutoring adults who wanted to improve their English speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills.\n\nAside from this experience, my qualifications include CELTA (the highest teaching certification for ESL), academic background in linguistics (the scientific study of language, its history, and individual acquisition), and a personal multicultural background that further allows me to connect with students of varying cultures.\n\nMy academic experience has resulted in strong writing skills, and I am happy to work with students to likewise strengthen their academic writing style. My background in linguistics means that I can truthfully answer those unanswerable questions such as \"why are these silent letters still included in the spelling?\" and \"why are these words pronounced like this?\" and \"why does this grammar structure work in English?\".\n\nPlease contact me for more details about my teaching and educational background. I'm happy to work with you. Message me today to schedule a lesson!",

I also enjoy teaching ESL as well. \n\n¡Buenas a todos!\n\nEstudié la lingüística hispánica en la universidad y la biología.  Empecé dar clases de inglés a hispanohablantes en 2009. Me encanta enseñar el inglés porque me da la oportunidad de hacer que mis alumnos puedan expresarse en otro idioma.  Mi metodología didáctica es más informal. A mi me gusta enseñarle al alumno un punto gramatical y luego tener una conversación en que el alumno tiene que utilizar este punto para hablar. Me gustan mucho los temas la pronunciación y la acentuación para que un alumno pueda hablar más como un nativo y pueda entender como un nativo. Para cualquier duda, póngase en contacto conmigo. \n\n¡Un saludo!",

I have taught Spanish at different levels, including Advanced Placement; Italian at at different levels, including Advanced Placement and ESL. I have taught from elementary to college levels. At college level, I have taught  Advanced Italian and Culture and Cinema courses as well.\n\nAs you can see from the paragraph above, I am  an experienced instructor who is interested in helping students in several ways: improving speaking skills, writing, reading, grammar, cultural knowledge, and literature and cinema. I tailor classes to meet students needs. I discuss with students what their needs and goals are and I plan and design my lessons based on what needs to be covered. I use textbooks if they are necessary, but I also enjoy using my own materials. I enjoy using authentic materials. I also know the content that needs to be covered for SAT II Italian or Spanish and Spanish AP and Italian AP  classes so I can help students to succeed at those exams. I can work face to face with students, but I also use Skype and other online resources.\n\nOver the last years, I have become very familiar with editing papers, projects and MA dissertations as well. This is something that can easily be arranged online. I specialize in editing academic papers since I know the publishing world very well.\n\nThank you for your time.",

            "FreeResponse": "Hi! My name is Olivia, and I am a recent graduate of Virginia Tech, where I majored in Environmental Policy and Planning, with two minors: one in Leadership and Social Change, the other in Women and Gender Studies. During college, I worked for multiple nonprofits, participated in several clubs, served as a Teaching Assistant to freshmen level leaderships classes for two semesters, and was a live-in mentor in a leadership dorm.\n\nWhile I am brand new to the Wyzant community, I am not brand new to tutoring. I got my first taste of tutoring as a child, when I helped my brother work through his homework with his learning disability. In high school, I found myself in a more structured tutoring environment, where I helped kids from grade 1 through 6 with their homework at a local community center. My last year of college, I worked with an early childhood development organization as a volunteer for preschool and kindergarten literacy intervention. Finally, my current position as a reading interventionist at an elementary school in Petersburg, Virginia, has me working with students in order to help them achieve their grade-level reading proficiency.\n\nMy language learning extends beyond my various positions as a tutor. Coming from a bilingual-home, I'm conversationally fluent in Spanish (my mother is Puerto Rican) and often act as a mediator for my non-Spanish speaking friends and family when we visit Spanish-speaking countries. I also took Latin for 4 years in high school (not only becoming president of my school's Latin club for 2 years, but also winning awards in the National Latin Exam for three years in a row). \n\nMy more professional experiences with language-learning, as well as my personal experiences, have shaped my personal teaching style and approach into one that caters to how an individual learns. I'm very cognizant of each individual's learning style and I like my teaching style to best cater to them (auditory, visual, tactile, etc.) I believe patience, positive-reinforcement, and repetition are some of the most important tools a teacher has in teaching effectively. \n\nWhile being a native English speaker generally qualifies one for at least a basic level of English tutoring, my English grammar and vocabulary skills present a much more sophisticated level of tutoring, particularly for those hoping to become both fluent and eloquent in the English language!\n\nDue to my position as a reading interventionist, I am only available virtually. However, I strive to be flexible and affordable. Learning shouldn't be painful! Please contact me to learn more about how I can help you.",

            "FreeResponse": "Hello !\n\nMy name is Krystie Fernandez and I am a 22-year old student in college majoring in Psychology. I am bilingual in both English and Spanish. \n\nMy story: \nWhen I was a child, my first language was Spanish. When I learned English I didn't want to speak Spanish because everyone in school spoke English. Spanish was something I was ashamed of speaking because I grew up in a town where the percentage of Spanish-Speaking people was about 5%. My family, being the traditional Latinos they were, would yell at me for not embracing my culture. My Spanish was not as good as when I was a child, and my parents were pretty upset that they let that happen. So they began speaking only Spanish with me. Everyday I'd come home from school speaking English, and they'd never answer. So I was being forced to speak Spanish in order to communicate. At first it was frustrating because I didn't want to speak it. For me, English was easier.  But soon, I got used to it, and even sooner, I sounded fluent with no accent. After entering high school and meeting people who wish they spoke Spanish, I realized I wanted to thank my parents. I really had appreciated that they made me bilingual. So I decided that I wanted to truly master the Spanish language by learning how to read and write. I joined AP Spanish, where we learned grammar, literature, and writing in Spanish.  Back then, being bilingual meant nothing. But today, many jobs require you to be bilingual in English and Spanish. And that's where opportunities flourished for me. I learned how important it is nowadays to know these two languages. \n\nWhat I do and Why:\nUpon learning both languages, I found myself picking out the best methods for me to learn. As a child until the end of high school, I constantly tried to figure out the best methods of learning languages. With research, and trial/error, I realized that there are so many interactive ways to learn a language and actually have the brain retain the information. After researching languages, by majoring in Psychology, I figured out ways the brain can retain new information. After putting all the information together, I realized I wanted to apply my knowledge with experience. So I took up Italian, to test my methods with learning a new language and found them effective for myself. I then took up tutoring to help children and adults learn and master these two languages (English and Spanish).  I have been tutoring for a year now and my students and I find satisfaction in teaching my methods. I'd like to consider myself patient, honest, and non-judgmental. Teaching and language are not my major in college, but they are something I enjoy doing and have experience in.\n\nHopefully, the parent or student reading this, decide to take a chance with me and allow me to help the student rise and actually enjoy learning a new language. Whether it's helping with Spanish homework, or ESL, or one on one tutor sessions, I hope I can be there to help.",

            "FreeResponse": "I started working as a tutor in high school, volunteering at an after-school program for elementary and middle school students. I managed to keep tutoring in college through a federal work study program called America Read. I was a reading coach; essentially, my responsibilities included aiding children from ages 4 to 14 with reading comprehension. From practicing vocabulary to proofreading essays, I acquired a good deal of experience in my three years with America Reads. I was even able to participate in an academic summer camp for lower income children. Again, my function was to be a reading coach during my three months in the camp.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I have taught English at the university level. During 2015, I was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to teach English in Brazil. I worked at the Federal University of Goias in the city of Goiania; I served as an English Teaching Assistant for approximately ten months. This was a rewarding opportunity that allowed me to work with individuals from all backgrounds and all levels of education (i.e. undergraduate, graduate). \r\n\r\nOne of my majors in college was Spanish. Thus I have a Bachelor of Art in Spanish; I am fluent in writing, speaking, and reading. Also, I studied abroad for a semester in Chile. Thus, I have experience in an environment of full-immersion in Spanish.\r\n\r\nBeing a double major of Spanish and International Studies, my humanities/social science academic background has made me an expert in critical textual analysis. It has also allowed me to develop strong writing abilities. These skills will be very helpful in tutoring anyone with problems tackling English.\r\n\r\nI am very friendly and flexible with scheduling sessions. I look forward to getting to work! ",

For me, the best part of working with children is making them laugh and giving them confidence.  Seeing a smile on their face gives me great pleasure.  I love to joke and play with them at all ages.  \n\nI also see such brave and brilliant children progress through the years.  The biggest and greatest gift we can give children is love and confidence.  They are a real blessing and always need support from us parents and people that care about them.  \n\nAfter all, we were all kids once!  :)",

I graduated from University of South Florida's Tampa campus in 2016 with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders, specializing in Sign Language Interpreting; I also hold an Associate's degree in Sociology. I have been fortunate to be involved professionally in public education as since 2009 at the middle school level in a variety of capacities. On top of my regular, work-based duties, I have tutored in Adult Education, provided community ASL classes, and and done private tutoring for Elementary and Middle school aged children.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best part of this line of work is breaking down the barriers in comprehension and the light that comes on when my student is able to grasp something they have been struggling with. I look forward to contributing to your success.\r\n\r\nBesides working as an interpreter in my school-based duties, I also provide tutoring and instructional support for my students outside of class. I have provided this coverage in topics ranging from remediating elementary level math all the way up to advanced level classes. In the last year, all of my students showed marked improvements in their FSA scores. \r\n\r\nMy experience with science is very similar to my qualifications in math. I have experience providing educational support in science fields ranging from remediation of elementary level science, Earth science, Life science, Physical science, and Biology.\r\n\r\nSign Language is the primary focus of my professional career and the degree that I was awarded. I have tutored this subject extensively, and find that teaching people new ways to communicate opens up so many more avenues to learning and experiencing life.\r\n\r\nGrowing up, I was the student that had stereotypical \"boy handwriting\". After extensive work, my own handwriting has improved immensely, and I used the strategies that I learned with my students. They have, almost universally, improved their skills in both cursive and print writing.\r\n\r\nI am very easily reached by email, and provide quick responses at almost any time during the day. Please feel free to contact me regarding any questions, comments, or concerns.",

In 2011 I received my BA from the University of Denver in Theater and Religious Studies and I recently completed an MFA in Sound Design as well as an MA in Cinema Studies from Savannah College of Art and Design. My love of sharing and watching people grow through learning led me to pursue tutoring as an occupation.\n\nI  strive to engage students by teaching through hands-on methods and activities that allow for creativity. My previous students have ranged from 2 years old to well into middle age, so I am open and able to teaching any age group.   \n\nStyle-wise, the manner in which I impart knowledge is geared toward anyone who knows how to work hard, and isn't afraid to be a bit silly. Movement will always be part of any lesson, as I find incorporating a multitude of senses improves information retention.\n\nAdditionally, I am comfortable working with students who do not speak English as a first language. I am TEFL and CRLA certified to teach English to speakers of other languages.  Focusing on practical application of concepts, such as using vocabulary in conversation and sentence construction was the ultimate goal during my 6 weeks with the children.\n\nI look forward to helping you or your child achieve success in their education and build confidence for independent problem solving.",

I would love to use my second language skills to help students trying to learn the language or get better at it.   I have college based research experience and have even published a few articles. I feel very confident when it comes to grammar, punctuation and sentence structure.  I have always enjoyed helping others and have experience working with children ages 3-17 and adults. I have experience working with children and youth of different races, cultures, abilities, genders, and academic levels.  I gained experience by volunteering at a shelter for abused children in which I cared for children and helped them with their homework. By volunteering at the shelter I attended various training that helped me learn to better care and assist children who were victims of negligence and abuse. \r\n\r\nI also gained experienced by working as a Girl Scout program facilitator and camp counselor. At girl scouts, I facilitated troops of girls ages 5 to 13. I was responsible for creating my own lesson plans. I often incorporated writing, reading, and Spanish into the curriculum and helped the girls with their homework.\r\n\r\n I  also worked as a preschool teacher for half a year. My responsibilities included coming up with a weekly lesson plan, reinforcing the safety of the children, and creating a comfortable learning environment. \r\n\r\nI also gained experience by working as a behavioral instructor for children within the autism spectrum. In this position I followed programs tailored to the children's need. I helped them with basic tasks like homework or like skills like sharing and expressing emotions.  \r\n\r\nI love tutoring because it allows me to build up my client's confidence and help them when they are having difficulties.

I am currently a law enforcement officer and have been for approximately five years now. Throughout my career, I have informally educated many new employees on the art of law enforcement report writing, to include grammar, punctuation, flow, and logic. I have consistently been rated by my supervisors as an outstanding writer. \r\n\r\nPrior to being a police officer, I attended Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, where I excelled in writing classes and I was able to, in an unofficial capacity, teach fellow students on basic essay writing principles. Although my experience as an educator may not be extensive, I possess the basic skills and abilities to be a great tutor. I have excellent oral and written communication skills and I am highly motivated to be the best tutor I can be. \r\n\r\nAnother one of my strong subjects is Spanish, as I am a fluent and native Spanish speaker. As a law enforcement officer stationed in Puerto Rico, I utilize the Spanish language (written and orally) on a daily basis in a professional setting. Throughout my professional career, I have also passed several Spanish aptitude tests with ratings of Professional Conversational.\r\n\r\nGreat tutors are patient, compassionate, knowledgeable, and thrive on the happiness a student experiences when they finally understand a concept they could not grasp without the help of the tutor. I exemplify and live by all of the aforementioned principles and qualities when it comes to education. My student's failure to understand or success in understanding a given concept is a direct reflection of myself and I take that very seriously. Second, I consider myself to be a great writer. Throughout my academic and professional career, writing is the one skill that I have always thrived in. Throughout, I have always been rated exceptional writer and I want to impart some of the knowledge and passion that I have of writing to students that seek my help.\r\n\r\nPrior to choosing law enforcement as my career path, I did tons of research on numerous careers. I wanted to be 100% sure that what I was choosing as a career for my life was going to be in sink with my personality, skills, and abilities. In addition, I wanted to help society out as best as I could. This knack for over=analyzing career decisions has made me very knowledgeable on different career paths and what it takes to be successful, regardless of the career path one chooses. I can provide guidance and clarity, in addition to, information on academic requirements to someone who is looking for career development advice.\r\n\r\nI have also been playing basketball since I was 13 years old. I played basketball in numerous organized leagues in high school and in college. I can provide guidance and tips to get you to the next level!\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact me at any time of the day with any questions you may have.

Currently, I am taking a gap year before going to medical school in the fall of 2018 and am tutoring in the Sarasota/Bradenton. My experience mentoring students is both extensive and varied. For about two years in high school, I tutored other high school students in Algebra I, II, geometry, calculus, statistics, and physics, as well as in AP U.S. History and AP U.S. Government through the National Honor Society. This work, along with other efforts I was involved in, earned me the Congressional Medal of Merit during my senior year. Throughout my four years in college, I independently tutored fellow students in trigonometry, general chemistry, and pathophysiology classes. Additionally, I have mentored over 60 students through my position as President Pro Tempore in the Student Government Association at UCF. In this role, I met one-on-one with students, helping them to set goals and understand what SGA had to offer, as well as taught larger groups of students about teamwork and leadership skills. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to tutoring, one size does not fit all. Students learn material in many different ways, and a good tutor needs to recognize this early. During our first lesson, I will evaluate your learning style and adjust my teaching style to best fit your needs. When material is firmly understood, and not just memorized, it will be retained, which is key to performing well on exams, especially standardized tests like the SAT and ACT. As your tutor, your success is my only goal. Watching my students progress and improve brings me great satisfaction and I am eager to work with you to help you succeed and reach your goals, whatever they may be. Having maintained a strong GPA throughout college, in addition to tutoring fellow students, I am confident in my abilities to provide assistance to middle school, high school, and college students in math (Prealgebra, Algebra I/II, Geometry, Trigonometry & Statistics), science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), U.S. History & U.S. Government, as well as for SAT, ACT, MCAT & GRE test prep. \r\n\r\nSo whether you are a student looking to get ahead in class, preparing for the SAT or ACT, or a parent looking for someone to supplement your child's learning in the classroom, I am ready to work with you. My schedule is flexible and I am able to meet at your house or at a public location, such as the library or a coffee shop. I look forward to getting started and encourage you to reach out to me",

My process is both iterative and Socratic, and I encourage my students to continually question and re-examine the subject-matter, so as to ensure full understanding and the applicability of the material beyond the specific scope of the tutoring session. For the more humanistic subjects, I believe in a discussion-based approach, where student and tutor work through the material together. For language study, grammar and morphology are emphasized, and I try to move to text-based translation as soon as possible (because its much more fun than exercises!). For test prep, I follow the practice methods of the Kaplan Test Prep company. For writing, I draw from my academic/professional writing courses at the University of Chicago as well as my extensive professional experience as a grant writer, editor, and blogger.\r\n",

I was a teacher in Mexico, where I got my BA in Graphic Design, I was an Elementary Art Teacher (I had 600 students from 1-6 grade). \r\n\r\nWhat I love about teaching is being able to help and make things easier for students. I am ADHD and Dyslexic, so I can relate to the frustration of struggling in class, but you also learn tricks and ways to help yourself. The key is knowing what your weaknesses and strengths are, that way you can improve your weaknesses by using your strengths.\r\n\r\nGrowing up math was always my strong subject, it always made sense. Even though I was an art teacher I would help my students with their math. \r\n\r\nI am 100% Bilingual Spanish-English. I've spoken Spanish all my life and went to college in Mexico, I would say it's my strongest subject to teach.\r\n\r\nI'm currently enrolled in an Interpreting Program, I am halfway through the program. Although I would never believe I am at a point where I could teach ASL I could definitely help tutor using ASL.\r\n\r\nI enjoy teaching and making it fun, I'm easy going but also like to get things done. I will try my best to help you achieve your goals and have fun in the process.",

This exchange makes both tutor and student active participants of the learning process making the experience rich in both ways. I am a stronger believer that a big difference between individual success and failure depends on the education and interest in learning languages.\r\n\r\nAfter working so many years in the area I know I can add value to the language and speech learning process because I have seen tangible benefits for career development in global organizations. I am sure, I can add value teaching Spanish as well as providing advice on how a speech can be prepared with structure and practice.\r\n\r\nEn resumen, me encantaria poner a su disposicion mis conocimientos y experiencia en el aprendizaje del espanol para tener una ventaja competitva en su future Carrera.\r\n\r\nSpanish is my native language and I had outstanding teachers when I was in high school and college. After my bachelor's graduation, I started my teaching experience as teacher assistant in Communications and Spanish for the students of Business Administration in their first year. Some years later, I managed the Training and People Development programs for a 500 Fortune company. In those 13 years I got certified in global and local programs for the employees at all levels, facilitating programs in presentation skills, coaching and feedback and selling skills among others\r\n\r\nI can accommodate my schedule at your convenience but on the other hand, I  would appreciate a 24 hours notice for class cancellation for the benefit of other students willing to take your place instead. Thanks in advance for trusting in my tutoring capabilities",

I have independently tutored high school and college students for five years now in the areas of physics, calculus, and programming. This summer I went to the Dominican Republic to teach English for three months to college age baseball players. I have mastered many programming languages including Java, Javascript and Python through watching countless tutorials and learning how to apply the concepts into the apps I develop. I love working with data structures and testing my knowledge in real life situations and simulation with my programming. My programming skills have earned me an internship at Lockheed Martin in the past. I taught myself Spanish over the course of the last two years, as well as learned a lot in high school. The thing that brings the most joy is seeing improvement with the ones I teach. I live for it, as I plan on teaching engineering and English to people of foreign countries in the future.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has learned Spanish in high school, and taught himself the rest of what he knows, I am qualified to be teaching English to Spanish speakers. This summer I went to Boca Chica, Dominican Republic to teach English for the New York Mets Baseball academy for three months to college age baseball players, all of whom loved my class. Anyone who knows what its like teaching English to athletes who mainly want to focus on baseball knows how much of a feat it is to get them to love your class and look forward to attending. I love to teach myself different languages. I have gained a high level of proficiency in speaking Spanish and I am currently teaching myself Haitian Creole. I know countless different ways of learning languages and will make sure that the learner is at a high level in absolutely no time!\r\n\r\nI have learned the art of programming for five years now, and when I started I never looked back. I am a software engineering major at the University of South Florida and have taken multiple classes that use Java, Python, and more. I have gone through countless hours of Coursera, Udemy, YouTube, and even LinkedIn learning different concepts of programming, data structures, ways to apply your programming to real life situations, applying your code to designing  functioning apps, video games, and how to beat programming interview questions! My expertise in programming concepts knows few bounds. My dream is to work for Google developing applications and I will use that drive to be able to teach others across the world the beautiful art of engineering. Come join me as you master programming!",
